Q1. What do you mainly use your phone for?

Yes, I share my phone with my wife and sometimes with other workers if they need to make a call. I don’t know how to say no.

I mostly use phone calls, WhatsApp, YouTube, and the camera. I use the camera only if someone asks me to take a photo of work.

If my co-workers or children say it is okay, then I use it. I don’t install apps by myself.

I remove the SIM card. I don’t know how to delete everything, so I feel scared giving the phone for repair.

Yes, I ask my children, younger workers, or go to a mobile shop. I feel shy because I don’t understand phones.
Q9. Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
I trust my wife and children. I don’t trust strangers.
Q10. Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?
Yes, I save numbers with short names so others don’t know who they are.

No, I don’t know about these things.
Q13. What do you do when you get warning messages on your phone?
I get scared and close the message. I usually show it to my children.
Q14. What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
I think the app can see those photos or numbers. I don’t know what happens after that.
Q15. Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
Yes, because family photos and messages are there. I worry someone may see them.
Q16. Has a repair person ever opened your photos or apps without asking?
Yes, once they opened my gallery saying storage is full. I didn’t say anything.
