Q1: What do you mainly use your phone for?
A: I use my phone mostly for WhatsApp. My customers send me blouse designs, measurements, and sometimes payment details there. I also watch stitching videos on YouTube, and sometimes listen to songs. I don’t use it for bank apps—I go to the ATM to check balance.
Q2: Do you share your phone with others?
A: Yes, I share it with my daughter. She helps me check WhatsApp when I don’t understand something. She also uses YouTube on it. But otherwise, no one else uses my phone.
Section 2: Awareness and Perceptions
Q3: What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?
A: I like WhatsApp because it helps with work. YouTube is also good for seeing new designs. I’ve never thought about what they collect from me. I didn’t know they can take anything.
Q4: When an app asks for permission, like to access your location or camera, do you read and understand what it means?
A: No, I don’t understand it. I ask my daughter. Sometimes I just press “Allow” to make it work.
Q5: How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?
A: I only use what my daughter or brother tells me to. I don’t download anything by myself.
Section 3: Practices and Behaviors
Q6: Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?
A: Yes, sometimes if I get an unnecessary message from someone I don’t know, I delete it so my husband doesn’t think wrong.
Q7: If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?
A: I try to delete customer photos and messages. I don’t know how to remove everything, but I delete what I can.
Q8: Have you ever asked someone to help you with a phone problem?
A: Yes, my daughter or my brother. I feel shy when they open my phone and see personal things, so I tell them not to check my photos.
Section 4: Trust and Sharing
Q9: Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
A: Only in person. I don’t send anything important on the phone. If I have to, I call the person directly.
Q10: Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?
A: Sometimes, I save customer names with a code so my husband doesn’t ask too many questions.
Section 5: Digital Literacy and Consent
Q11: Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?
A: No, I usually ask for help. I’m not confident in teaching others about phones.
Q12: Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, microphone, or location?
A: No, I don’t know how to do that.
Q13: When you get a warning message (“this app may harm your phone”), what do you usually do?
A: I show it to my daughter. I don’t install anything that gives such a warning.
Q14: What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
A: I didn’t know they can take my contacts or photos. That’s scary.
Section 6: Privacy and Repair
Q15: Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
A: Yes, I worry they will see my photos or customer messages, so I delete some of them before going.
Q16: Has a repair person ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?
A: I’m not sure, but once a man at the shop was touching things quickly. I felt uncomfortable.
Q17: Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?
A: No, it’s difficult for me to remember. But my daughter says I should.
Section 7: Trust and Social Influence
Q18: Do you think local apps are safer than international ones? Why?
A: I don’t know the difference. I just use what my daughter installs.
Q19: Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?
A: My daughter or brother. They know more about phones.
Q20: Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?
A: Yes, my brother tells me not to click on random messages. He says many are fake.
