P4, Homemaker, Age: 47 years, Education: MBA Graduate
Q1: What do you mainly use your phone for?
A.Right now, I use it mostly for WhatsApp to talk to my sister and some voice calls. I’m trying to learn how to browse for recipes and home tips on YouTube. I used to use more apps on my older phone, but this one is slow.
Q2: Do you share your phone with others?
A.I rarely share this phone—it’s already second-hand and a bit delicate. Only my daughter sometimes uses it to help me with apps.
Q3: What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?
A.WhatsApp and YouTube for now. I don’t know much about what apps collect. My daughter says, “Amma, don't click on strange messages.
Q4: When an app asks for permission, like access to location or contacts, do you read and understand what it means?
A.To be honest, I didn’t even notice permissions before. Now I look, but I don’t understand everything, so I just press “Allow” if the app is from a known place.
Q5: How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?
A.I trust the apps my daughter or relatives use. I haven’t tried anything alone yet.
Q6: Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?
A.Yes, I delete old messages and group forwards because my phone has low storage space. I’ve also deleted apps that keep sending pop-ups.
Q7: If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?
A.I haven’t repaired this phone yet, but I would go to the local mobile shop. I’ll ask my husband to come with me because I don’t feel confident going alone with this phone.
Q8: Have you ever asked someone to help you with a phone problem?
A.Yes, many times. My daughter or niece helps. I ask them to do it while I watch so I can learn, but sometimes they’re too fast!
Q9: Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
A.I trust family members. If I have to send something personal, I prefer to talk directly or send via WhatsApp to my husband or sister.
Q10: Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?
A.Not yet, but I’ve seen my niece do that with her friends. It’s interesting. I might start if needed.
Q11: Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?
A.Not yet. I’m the one asking for help now. Maybe one day I can help others too.
Q12: Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera or location?
A.No, but I want to learn this. My daughter said she’ll show me in settings.
Q13: When you get a warning message (“this app may harm your phone”), what do you usually do?
A.I get scared and stop using it. Once, I even deleted the app just to be safe.
Q14: What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
A.I think it helps in connecting to people, but I didn’t know it might keep that data. That worries me.
Q15: Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
A.Yes, I’m afraid they might check my photos or messages. I try to delete things before giving them, or ask my daughter to do it.
Q16: Has a repair person ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?
A.Not yet. But if that happens, I would feel very uncomfortable.
Q17: Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?
A.Yes, my daughter set a PIN for me. I know how to use it now.
Q18: Do you think local apps are safer than international ones? Why?
A.I really don’t know. I just use the ones my family uses.
Q19: Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?
A.My daughter, niece, or sometimes my husband. I also watch YouTube if it’s a simple thing.
A.Yes, my family warns me about scams and tells me to ignore strange calls or messages.
Scenarios:
Scenario 1: Broken Phone
If this phone breaks, I’ll delete my WhatsApp messages and photos, then give it to the repair shop. I will ask someone to come with me because I don’t trust the shop fully.
Scenario 2: Sharing a Phone with Family
Only my daughter uses it, and I don’t have anything secret. But I still close my chats before handing them over.
Scenario 3: Installing a New App
If the app asks for too many permissions, I leave it. I ask my daughter if she says it’s safe, only then do I install.
Scenario 4: Helping an Elderly Relative
I’m still learning myself, but if my aunt asks, I’ll try or ask someone younger in the house to help her.
Scenario 5: Using a Borrowed Phone
I won’t touch anything extra. If something opens by mistake, I close it immediately. I believe in privacy.
Scenario 6: Selling or Giving Away a Phone
Before giving, I will delete everything I can. But for full formatting, I’ll ask my daughter to do it.
Scenario 7: Cloud Backup Surprise:
This happened once—I deleted photos, but later they were still in some Google thing. I was confused. Now I know a bit about cloud backup.
Scenario 8: Using Free Public WiFi:
I don’t use free WiFi. My son says it’s risky. I stick to mobile data even if it’s slow.
Scenario 9: Receiving a lottery:
No, I would never give my details. I already got such a call and blocked the number. It felt fake.
Scenario 10: Sharing account details:
If a close friend is in trouble, I’ll ask my daughter to help transfer money. I don’t do it alone yet.
