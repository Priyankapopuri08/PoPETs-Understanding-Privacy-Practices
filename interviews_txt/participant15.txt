Q1: What do you mainly use your phone for?
A: I use my phone mostly for work—Google Maps for delivery, Zomato Partner app, WhatsApp for talking to friends, and Paytm for money transactions. I also watch YouTube shorts and reels. I sometimes use Snapchat, mainly for filters with friends.
Q2: Do you share your phone with others?
A: Not really. Only if a friend urgently needs to make a call or check something. I don’t like people touching my phone too much.
Section 2: Awareness and Perceptions
Q3: What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?
A: I like Google Maps and YouTube. Snapchat is fun for timepass. I know these apps take data because I get ads based on what I search, especially on YouTube and Facebook.
Q4: When an app asks for permission, like to access your location or camera, do you read and understand what it means?
A: Sometimes I read, but mostly I allow it if the app looks safe or I’ve used it before. For unknown apps, I think twice.
Q5: How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?
A: If it has many downloads on Play Store, or if my friends use it, I trust it. I also check reviews and whether it looks clean and professional.
Section 3: Practices and Behaviors
Q6: Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?
A: Yes, I delete chats sometimes if I think someone might misinterpret. Even silly chats with female friends can cause drama.
Q7: If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?
A: I log out of apps like Paytm and delete private photos or move them to Google Drive. I also try to clean the gallery and cache.
Q8: Have you ever asked someone to help you with a phone problem?
A: Yes, my cousin is very techy. I trust him, but I sit beside him when he’s fixing something—just in case.
Section 4: Trust and Sharing
Q9: Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
A: In person. Face-to-face is better than on phone. I don’t trust calls or messages for personal stuff.
Q10: Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?
A: Definitely! Especially while chatting in groups or with a girlfriend. We use names that only we understand.
Section 5: Digital Literacy and Consent
Q11: Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?
A: Yes, I’ve helped many coworkers with Zomato onboarding, Paytm setup, even UPI. I explain about permissions and to be careful with unknown links.
Q12: Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, microphone, or location?
A: Yes, I go to app settings and turn off permissions sometimes. Especially for apps I don’t trust.
Q13: When you get a warning message (“this app may harm your phone”), what do you usually do?
A: I avoid it. I don’t want to risk my phone getting slow or hacked.
Q14: What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
A: I think it may use it to show ads, or sometimes even sell the data. I’m not fully sure how, but I feel it’s not good to give every app that permission.
Section 6: Privacy and Repair
Q15: Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
A: Yes. I delay repairs until I back everything up or remove sensitive stuff.
Q16: Has a repair person ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?
A: Once a guy opened my photos “by mistake” and smiled at something. I didn’t say anything but felt very angry.
Q17: Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?
A: Yes, fingerprint and PIN. No one else knows it. It’s basic security.
Section 7: Trust and Social Influence
Q18: Do you think local apps are safer than international ones? Why?
A: Depends. I trust big names like Google or Instagram more than random Indian apps. But local language apps are easier for some people.
Q19: Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?
A: Cousin, or sometimes I watch YouTube tutorials.
Q20: Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?
A: Yes. My friends share warnings on WhatsApp about scams, like “don’t click this link” etc.
Scenarios
Scenario 1: Broken Phone
A: I would back up work data to Drive, logout from bank apps, and delete sensitive chats. Only then I’ll go to a trusted shop.
Scenario 2: Sharing with Family
A: If a message pops up while my phone is with a cousin, I ask them not to open it or I grab it quickly.
Scenario 3: New App Requesting Permissions
A: I check what it’s asking. If it's contacts and location for no reason, I won’t install. Rewards can be traps.
Scenario 4: Helping Elderly Relative
A: I help my uncle often. I explain, “this permission means app can use your mic,” but he doesn’t fully get it.
Scenario 5: Using Someone Else’s Phone
A: I avoid checking their stuff. It’s basic respect. If I see something private, I ignore and return the phone fast.
Scenario 6: Giving Away Phone
A: I’ll do a full factory reset. And remove my Google account before giving it to anyone.
Scenario 7: Cloud Backup Surprise
A: I’ve seen old photos reappear in Google Photos. Now I delete from cloud too. At first, I was shocked.
Scenario 8: Free Public WiFi
A: I avoid public WiFi for banking. Maybe for YouTube, but not Paytm or net banking.
Scenario 9: Lottery Call
A: I’ve got such calls. I play along sometimes, then block them. I never share personal details.
Scenario 10: Friend Needs Help
A: If it’s an emergency, I’ll help, but I’ll talk to him directly and confirm. No blind trust.
