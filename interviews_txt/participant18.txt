Q1: What do you mainly use your phone for?
A: I use it mostly for calling my family, listening to songs on YouTube, and using WhatsApp to send photos of the clothes I stitch to customers. Sometimes, I use it for watching recipe videos too.
Q2: Do you share your phone with others?
A: Yes, my children sometimes use it to watch cartoons, and my husband uses it to check some news or cricket scores. I don’t mind, but I try to keep personal messages cleared.
Section 2: Awareness and Perceptions
Q3: What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?
A: I use WhatsApp and YouTube the most. WhatsApp helps with customers and YouTube is good for learning new designs. I haven’t thought much about what these apps collect. I just use them.
Q4: When an app asks for permission, like to access your location, camera, or contacts, do you read and understand what it means?
A: No, I usually press ‘allow’ because otherwise the app doesn’t open. I don’t understand what all it is asking. I’ve never asked anyone about it.
Q5: How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?
A: I only install apps that my cousin or children suggest. I don’t download on my own. If the name sounds unfamiliar, I avoid it.
Section 3: Practices and Behaviors
Q6: Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?
A: Yes, sometimes I delete messages from customers if I think my husband might not like it, even if it’s work-related. Just to avoid problems.
Q7: If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?
A: I try to remove my SIM card and memory card. I don’t know how to delete everything. My nephew helps me if I’m worried.
Q8: Have you ever asked someone to help you with a phone problem?
A: Yes, my nephew or neighbor’s boy. I feel nervous when they touch the phone because they might see personal messages or photos, but I don’t know how to fix things myself.
Section 4: Trust and Sharing
Q9: Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
A: I only talk about important or private things face to face, never over the phone. I don’t send voice messages or sensitive photos.
Q10: Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?
A: Not really. Sometimes I use initials for names when saving numbers if I don’t want others to know, especially if it’s a male customer.
Section 5: Digital Literacy and Consent
Q11: Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?
A: No, others usually help me. I don’t feel confident in doing it myself or explaining to anyone else.
Q12: Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, microphone, or location?
A: No, I didn’t know we could do that. I just use whatever it asks and try not to press wrong buttons.
Q13: When you get a warning message (“this app may harm your phone”), what do you usually do?
A: I get scared and ask someone before clicking anything. If it looks dangerous, I don’t open it again.
Q14: What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
A: I think it just helps the app work. I didn’t know it can use that for anything else.
Section 6: Privacy and Repair
Q15: Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
A: Yes, especially if I have customer orders or messages. I feel shy giving it to male shopkeepers.
Q16: Has a repair person ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?
A: Once, a shop person checked the gallery while fixing the camera. I didn’t like it, but I didn’t say anything. I just took the phone and left quickly.
Q17: Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?
A: I use a pattern lock. My husband and children know it. It’s just to avoid strangers opening it.
Section 7: Trust and Social Influence
Q18: Do you think local apps are safer than international ones? Why?
A: I don’t know much about that. I just trust what people around me suggest. I don’t use many apps anyway.
Q19: Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?
A: My nephew or neighbor’s son. They’re young and understand better.
Q20: Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?
A: Yes, my cousin once told me not to share OTP or click on unknown links. Since then, I’m more careful.
