Scenario Responses (Elaborated)
Broken Phone (Repair Shop)
  If my phone breaks, I first delete all my private chats, gallery images, and remove my Google account. I also log out of Instagram and Snapchat. Then I give it for repair. I don’t feel safe otherwise.
Sharing Phone with Family
  I don’t usually give my phone, but if I have to, I clear my notifications, close apps, and hand it only for a few minutes. I don’t want family to read anything personal.
Installing a New App
  I check Play Store ratings and reviews. If it asks for weird permissions (like access to SMS or camera for a game), I cancel the installation. I’ve learned that from experience.
Helping an Elderly Relative
  I helped my grandmother download a pension app. I installed it and showed her only what was necessary. I didn’t explain permissions — she wouldn’t understand, and it would confuse her.
Using a Borrowed Phone
  If a notification or image pops up while I’m using someone else’s phone, I just lock the screen immediately. I won’t mention it. Everyone deserves privacy.
Giving Away a Phone
  Before giving away a phone, I format it twice. I also log out of my Gmail, clear downloads, and remove any memory card or SIM. Only then I hand it over.
Cloud Backup Surprise
  Yes, once I deleted a private photo from the phone but it was still on Google Photos. Now I’ve turned off auto-sync and check the trash too.
Using Free Public WiFi
  I use free WiFi to watch YouTube sometimes, but I avoid logging into banking or Gmail. I know it can be risky. If needed, I turn on VPN.
Receiving a Lottery Call
  I got a call like that once. They said I won ?1 lakh. I told them “wrong number” and blocked it immediately. Too many scams these days.
Emergency Bank Transfer Request
  If it’s from a real friend, I confirm with a phone call first. Then I use UPI to send. If anything feels off, I don’t do it.
