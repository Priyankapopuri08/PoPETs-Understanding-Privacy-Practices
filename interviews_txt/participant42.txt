Scenario Responses (Elaborated)
Broken Phone (Repair Shop)
  When my phone stopped charging, I took it to the shop. I didn’t delete anything because I don’t know how. The man opened my gallery and looked at photos. I didn’t like it, but I kept quiet. I told my son later.
Sharing Phone with Family
  My husband uses the phone too. I don’t hide anything, but sometimes if my son sends a message, I delete it after listening so my husband doesn’t ask questions.
Installing a New App
  I never install apps. If someone says I should use something, I ask them to do it. I don’t touch anything on my own.
Helping an Elderly Relative
  I am not able to help others. I ask others to help me. If someone older asks me, I tell them to go to their children.
Using a Borrowed Phone
  If I borrow someone’s phone and see anything private, I return it quickly. I don’t like checking other people’s things.
Giving Away a Phone
  When I gave my old phone to my niece, my son took the phone and deleted everything. I didn’t know how to do it.
Cloud Backup Surprise
  Yes, once I deleted a photo but it came back. I was confused. My son said it’s stored somewhere else. He stopped that option for me.
Using Free Public WiFi
  I don’t know how to connect to WiFi. My phone uses mobile data that my son recharges for me.
Receiving a Lottery Call
  Yes, I got a call saying I won ?2 lakh. I believed it and told my son. He shouted at me and blocked the number.
Emergency Bank Transfer Request
  If someone calls asking for money, I never send anything. I tell my son. He says people cheat like this, so I don’t trust any such calls.
