App Trust: I trust Google apps. Others, I search reviews on YouTube before installing.
Content Deletion: I clear WhatsApp chats and call logs sometimes, especially if I talk to customers.

App Origin Preference: I prefer Indian apps, especially for payments. I use BHIM instead of foreign wallets.
Tech Help: YouTube first. If I can’t fix it, then my brother.
Social Influence: Auto driver group tells each other about frauds and new safety rules. We learn from each other.
Scenario Responses (Elaborated)
Broken Phone (Repair Shop)
  I remove SIM, delete payment QR code from my gallery, and uninstall PhonePe. I once heard that a mechanic scanned someone’s QR and took money, so I’m careful now.
Sharing Phone with Family
  I don’t share it, even with my wife. Once she gave the phone to my child and he deleted my UPI screenshot. So now, I keep the phone locked.
Installing a New App
  I check reviews and if I see too many permissions, like SMS or contacts, I avoid it. For payment apps, I trust only the government ones.
Helping an Elderly Relative
  I installed WhatsApp for my uncle and told him to use voice messages only. I explained how not to click links in messages. He understood some of it.
Using a Borrowed Phone
  If someone gives me their phone, I only use it for the exact thing I need. I turn off the screen if any personal messages pop up.
Giving Away a Phone
  Before giving my old phone to my nephew, I reset it completely and also removed my Google account. I didn’t want him to get my SMS or photos.
Cloud Backup Surprise
  Yes! I deleted some photos, but my son said they were still in Google Drive. I didn’t know. Now I use “delete from everywhere” option.
Using Free Public WiFi
  I only use it in emergencies. For anything related to bank or UPI, I wait for mobile data. I saw a video warning about WiFi frauds.
Receiving a Lottery Call
  Yes, someone called saying I won a car. I asked them to WhatsApp details and they cut the call. I blocked the number and told others in my group.
Emergency Bank Transfer Request
  If my friend says it’s an emergency, I call him to confirm. If it sounds odd or message comes from someone else’s phone, I don’t send anything.
