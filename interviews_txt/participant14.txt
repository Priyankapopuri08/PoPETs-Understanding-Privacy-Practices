P14, Zomato Delivery Boy, Age: 24 years, Education: 10th class
Q1: What do you mainly use your phone for?
A: I use it mostly for my delivery work—Google Maps, calls to customers, and checking orders on the Zomato app. I also use WhatsApp to stay in touch with my family and Snapchat to talk to a few friends. When I’m free, I watch reels on Instagram or videos on YouTube.
Q2: Do you share your phone with others?
A: Sometimes my younger brother uses it to play games or watch videos. Rarely, my friend might borrow it for a call. I don’t like giving it out too much because everything is connected—my money apps, work app, and personal messages.
Q3: What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?
A: Google Maps is very important for my job. WhatsApp and Instagram for staying connected, and I use Paytm for money transactions. I don’t think too much about what they collect, but I know some apps show me ads based on what I searched.
Q4: When an app asks for permission, like to access your location or contacts, do you read and understand what it means?
A: Sometimes I do, especially if it's asking for location or camera. If it’s a well-known app, I just allow it. But if it looks shady or new, I avoid or ask a friend.
Q5: How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?
A: If my friends use it or if it has good reviews on Play Store, I trust it. I also check how many downloads it has. If it’s a desi app and looks badly made, I don’t trust it even if it's local.
Q6: Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?
A: Yes, a few times. I deleted chats with a friend because I didn’t want my girlfriend to misunderstand. I also cleared some screenshots before giving my phone to my brother.
Q7: If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?
A: I delete private photos and log out of my banking app. I also try to set a screen lock. But sometimes I just hope they don’t check anything.
Q8: Have you ever asked someone to help you with a phone problem?
A: Yes, my friend who knows more about phones. I feel a bit weird if they go through my messages, so I try to solve the problem by showing only the issue, not giving them the phone unlocked.
Q9: Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
A: In person. For serious things like bank info, I don’t send it on WhatsApp. I’d rather call or meet the person.
Q10: Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?
A: Yes. Me and my friend sometimes use emojis or fake names on WhatsApp so others don’t understand. Like calling someone “Battery” instead of their real name.
Q11: Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?
A: Yes, I helped an uncle in my neighborhood install Paytm. I explained how to link the account and said not to share OTPs or click on strange links.
Q12: Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, microphone, or location?
A: Yes. I go to settings and turn off permissions if I feel it’s too much. I did this for one app that kept asking for camera access.
Q13: When you get a warning message (“this app may harm your phone”), what do you usually do?
A: I uninstall it immediately. I once installed something that made the phone slow, so now I’m more careful.
Q14: What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
A: I think it might use that data for showing ads or sending things to others. I don’t like giving contact access unless it’s needed.
Q15: Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
A: Yes. I don’t like strangers checking my photos or chats. I delete what I can before going.
Q16: Has a repair person ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?
A: Once. I noticed later that my phone’s gallery was open. I felt really angry but didn’t say anything. Just didn’t go back there again.
Q17: Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?
A: Yes, fingerprint and pattern. My work and personal stuff are all there, and I don’t want anyone to open it randomly.
Q18: Do you think local apps are safer than international ones? Why?
A: Not really. Some local apps are good, but many are buggy or look fake. I trust Google apps more. Still, I support Indian apps if they work well.
Q19: Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?
A: My friend who works at a phone shop. He explains it better than watching YouTube videos.
Q20: Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?
A: Yes, especially one friend who’s really careful. He told me not to use the same password for everything and not to click on unknown links.
Scenarios
Scenario 1: Broken Phone
A: I would back up my photos to Google, clear chats, log out of Paytm and Zomato, and then give the phone. I don’t want my earnings or chats seen.
Scenario 2: Sharing with Family
A: If I got a private message while my brother was using my phone, I’d delete it quickly or use the WhatsApp lock feature.
Scenario 3: New App Requesting Permissions
A: I’d check if it looks genuine, see reviews, and then decide. If it asks for contact and location for no reason, I don’t install.
Scenario 4: Helping Elderly Relative
A: Yes, I would explain what each permission means. Like, “this app wants to know your location because it needs to show nearby doctors.”
Scenario 5: Using Someone Else’s Phone
A: I’d ignore the message or photo and give the phone back. I’d never mention it unless it’s something urgent or serious.
Scenario 6: Giving Away a Phone
A: I would factory reset it and remove the SIM and SD card before giving it away. I learned that from a YouTube video.
Scenario 7: Cloud Backup Surprise
A: I’d be shocked. I didn’t know deleted photos could still be online. I would then go and delete from the cloud, too.
Scenario 8: Free Public WiFi
A: I won’t use it for banking. Maybe to check YouTube, yes, but not to log in into Paytm or UPI apps.
Scenario 9: Lottery Call
A: I block them. I know it’s fake. They try to trick people into giving OTPs.
Scenario 10: Friend Needs Help
A: I’d transfer if I trust the friend and if it’s an emergency. But I’ll double-check the details and call to confirm.
