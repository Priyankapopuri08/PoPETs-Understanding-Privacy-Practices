Q1: What do you mainly use your phone for?
A: I use my phone mostly for messaging on WhatsApp, Snapchat, and watching YouTube videos. I also check my bank balance and do online shopping sometimes.
Q2: Do you share your phone with others? If yes, with whom and how often?
A: Not really. Sometimes my younger sister uses it to watch videos, but not very often. Mostly I keep my phone to myself.
Q3: What are your favorite apps or features on your phone? Why do you use those apps? Have you thought about what information they might be collecting?
A: Snapchat and WhatsApp are my favorites because I like chatting and sharing pictures. I have thought a bit about data collection—like Snapchat probably collects location and contacts—but I’m not too worried about it.
Q4: When an app asks for permission, like to access your location, camera, or contacts, do you read and understand what it means?
A: Usually, I skim through the permissions and accept if they seem normal. For example, Snapchat needs camera and contacts, so I allow it. But I don’t read everything carefully.
Q5: How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?
A: I check reviews and if the app is popular on the Play Store. Also, if friends use it and recommend it, I feel safer to use it.
Q6: Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?
A: Yes, I’ve deleted some chats and pictures from Snapchat because they were personal and I didn’t want my family to see them.
Q7: If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?
A: I try to backup important data and delete any sensitive photos or apps. I usually log out from accounts too.
Q8: Have you ever asked someone (friend/repairer/child) to help you with a phone problem? How did you feel about them seeing your personal data?
A: Yes, once I asked a friend to fix some app issues. I was a bit uncomfortable because he saw some private messages, but I trusted him.
Q9: Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
A: Mostly close friends and family. I prefer sharing sensitive stuff face-to-face or through WhatsApp with people I trust.
Q10: Have you used code words, nicknames, or indirect language to keep something private?
A: Sometimes with friends, we use slang or nicknames to talk about private stuff, especially on group chats.
Q11: Have you ever helped someone install or use an app? What did you explain to them?
A: Yes, I’ve helped my parents install WhatsApp and explained how to keep passwords safe and not share OTPs with others.
Q12: Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, microphone, or location?
A: Yes, I go to app settings and disable permissions if I don’t want an app to access something.
Q13: When you get a warning message (e.g., “this app may harm your phone”), what do you usually do?
A: I uninstall the app or check reviews online before deciding to keep or remove it.
Q14: What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
A: I think the app stores that info to connect you with friends or for ads, but I’m not too worried unless it seems suspicious.
Q15: Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
A: Yes, sometimes I’m careful and delete sensitive stuff before repair.
Q16: Has a repair person, friend, or shopkeeper ever opened your gallery or apps without asking? How did you feel?
A: Once the repair person opened some apps without asking. I felt uncomfortable and asked them to stop.
Q17: Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not? Does anyone else know your password?
A: Yes, I use a fingerprint and PIN lock. Only I know the password.
Q18: Do you think apps from local developers are safer than international ones? Why?
A: Not really. I think safety depends on the app’s reputation, not where it’s from.
Q19: Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?
A: Usually friends or I search online for answers.
Q20: Do people around you influence the way you think about online safety?
A: Yes, friends often share tips about phishing or scams, so I’m cautious.
