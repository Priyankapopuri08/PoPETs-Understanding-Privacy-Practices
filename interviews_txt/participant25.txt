Q1: What do you mainly use your phone for?
A: I mostly use my phone for WhatsApp to talk to friends and family. I also use Snapchat to share pictures and videos. Since my job is delivery, I use maps and GPS a lot to find addresses. I sometimes watch videos on YouTube after work.
Q2: Do you share your phone with others? If yes, with whom and how often?
A: I don’t usually share my phone with anyone because I use it for work and personal stuff. Sometimes my younger brother borrows it to check WhatsApp or play games, but that’s rare and only when I’m around. Mostly, it’s just me using the phone.
Q3: What are your favorite apps or features on your phone? Why do you use those apps? Have you ever thought about what information these apps might be collecting from your phone?
A: My favorite apps are WhatsApp and Snapchat because I can stay connected with friends and share moments. I also use Google Maps a lot for directions. I know these apps collect some information like my location for maps, but I don’t really think much about what else they might take. I just want them to work well.
Q4: When an app asks for permission, like to access your location, camera, or contacts, do you read and understand what it means?
A: I usually just allow the permissions because the app needs it to work. Sometimes I read the message, but I don’t always understand everything. If it seems normal, I just click “Allow.” If I’m unsure, I ask my brother or friends.
Q5: How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?
A: I usually trust apps that are popular or recommended by friends. If it’s on the official Play Store and has good ratings, I feel it’s safe. I also check reviews sometimes, but not always.
Q6: Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?
A: Yes, I delete messages sometimes if they are personal or if I don’t want others to read them. I also hide some photos using app features because my family sometimes borrows my phone.
Q7: If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?
A: I try to back up my data and delete any personal files like photos or messages. I feel a little worried about someone seeing my private stuff, so I make sure to remove as much as I can.
Q8: Have you ever asked someone (friend/repairer/child) to help you with a phone problem? How did you feel about them seeing your personal data?
A: Yes, I’ve asked repair shops to fix my phone. I don’t like them looking through my data, but I can’t do much. I trust them mostly but try to clear sensitive things before giving the phone.
Q9: Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
A: I trust talking in person the most, especially for sensitive things. I also trust WhatsApp chats with close friends and family because it’s encrypted, but I avoid sharing very private info over apps if I can.
Q10: Have you used code words, nicknames, or indirect language to keep something private?
A: Yes, sometimes I use nicknames or slang with my friends when talking about something private. It feels safer that way, especially if someone else might see my messages.
Q11: Have you ever helped someone install or use an app? What did you explain to them?
A: Yes, I helped my mother install WhatsApp and taught her how to use it for calls and messages. I didn’t explain much about privacy or permissions; I mostly focused on how to send messages and pictures.
Q12: Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, microphone, or location?
A: Yes, I’ve seen the settings and changed permissions a few times, especially for apps I don’t fully trust. But sometimes it’s confusing, so I ask for help.
Q13: When you get a warning message (e.g., “this app may harm your phone”), what do you usually do?
A: I don’t install the app if I see a warning. I usually uninstall it or ignore it. If I’m not sure, I ask a friend who knows more.
Q14: What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
A: I think the app uses the contacts to connect with people and photos to let me share them. I’m not sure if they store or share them elsewhere, but I hope they only use them for the app’s purpose.
Q15: Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
A: Yes, I’m cautious about giving my phone for repair. I try to clear private things first because I don’t want someone snooping through my photos or messages.
Q16: Has a repair person, friend, or shopkeeper ever opened your gallery or apps without asking while using or fixing your phone? How did you feel?
A: Yes, once a repair person opened my gallery without permission. I felt uncomfortable but didn’t say anything. I just hoped they didn’t look at anything important.
Q17: Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not? Does anyone else know your password?
A: Yes, I use a PIN lock for my phone. I don’t share it with anyone because I want to keep my stuff private. Sometimes family asks, but I don’t give it.
Q18: Do you think apps from local developers are safer than international ones? Why?
A: I don’t think local apps are necessarily safer. I trust popular apps regardless of origin. But if it’s local and in my language, I might feel more comfortable using it.
Q19: Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?
A: I usually ask my younger brother or friends who know more about phones. Sometimes I watch videos online to learn.
Q20: Do people around you (family, friends, shopkeepers) influence the way you think about online safety?
A: Yes, my friends and brother often warn me about scams or suspicious links. I pay attention to their advice and try to be careful online.
