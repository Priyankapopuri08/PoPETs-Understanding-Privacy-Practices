P10, Zomato delivery agent, Age: 26 years, Education: 12th class
I use it mostly for work—Zomato delivery app, maps, and OTPs. Personally, I use WhatsApp, YouTube, and sometimes Snapchat to share funny videos with friends. I also use Paytm for payments and checking my balance.
Sometimes with my younger cousin or friends when they want to browse something. But I don’t like sharing it much, especially when I’m logged into apps for work.
Google Maps and Paytm for work. YouTube is my favorite for entertainment. Snapchat is fun too. I know these apps collect some data, like location or what I search for, but I think that’s normal nowadays.
I understand location and camera. I allow it if I trust the app. If it’s a random app, I get suspicious.
I check ratings and reviews. If it looks professional and many people use it, I trust it. Also, I avoid apps with too many ads or ones recommended by strangers on WhatsApp.
Yes, sometimes I delete chats or photos before giving my phone to someone. Mostly jokes from friends or memes that could be misunderstood.
I log out of all my apps and delete photos and work data. I also remove my SIM and memory card. I’m careful because everything is linked to my account.
Yes, sometimes my tech-savvy friend. I try not to let him open my chats or gallery. If needed, I sit beside him and explain what to fix.
In-person, always. If I have to share on the phone, I prefer WhatsApp voice messages to SMS. I avoid putting things in text.
Yes, with close friends. We say “blue file” for things we don’t want others to understand, like girlfriends or party plans.
Many times, especially older relatives. I explain how to use Paytm, and sometimes I tell them not to click “Allow” on everything.
Yes. I go to settings and turn off permissions if I feel something is fishy or not needed.
I uninstall it or don’t install at all. I’ve learned my lesson—once my phone got slow after installing such an app.
I think some apps use it for marketing or showing you ads. That’s why I don’t give contact access unless it’s WhatsApp or something useful.
Yes. I delayed it once and backed up everything to the cloud, then deleted it before going. Privacy is a real concern.
Once, a guy opened my WhatsApp. I told him clearly not to go into my personal stuff. He apologized.
Yes. Fingerprint lock and PIN. I don’t want anyone opening it, even by mistake.
Not always. I think international apps have more security, but local ones are easier in language. I check both.
My friend Ranjeet. He fixes everything. He watches tech videos and knows a lot.
Yes. One friend told me never to use public WiFi for banking. Since then, I have followed that.
Scenarios
Scenario 1: Broken Phone
A: I back up data on Drive or memory card, log out of all apps, and delete chats and photos. Only then I give it.
Scenario 2: Sharing with Family
A: If a message comes, I quickly check it or delete it later. I don’t let others scroll freely.
Scenario 3: New App Requesting Permissions
A: I check why it needs those permissions. If it doesn’t make sense, I skip it.
Scenario 4: Helping Elderly Relative
A: I explain permissions—like why camera or location is asked. I say “only allow if needed.”
Scenario 5: Using Someone Else’s Phone
A: If I see a private message or pic, I just ignore it. It’s their phone, their space.
Scenario 6: Giving Away Phone
A: I format it completely, remove Google account, and reset it. I also take out SIM and SD card.
Scenario 7: Cloud Backup Surprise
A: That actually happened to me! I deleted a photo, but it showed up on Google Photos. Now I always delete it from both places.
Scenario 8: Free Public WiFi
A: I connect only to watch videos. Never for banking or login. I heard it's risky.
Scenario 9: Lottery Call
A: I cut the call. No such luck exists. They just want your bank info.
Scenario 10: Friend Needs Help
A: If I trust the friend, I’ll send it. But I confirm on call first—no text-only requests.
