P46, Male, Delivery Boy, Age: 29 years, Education: 4th standard
Q1. What do you mainly use your phone for?
I use my phone mainly for delivery work. I use delivery apps to accept orders, check addresses, call customers, and confirm deliveries. I also use Google Maps for navigation. Apart from work, I use WhatsApp, YouTube, and sometimes Facebook.
Q2. Do you share your phone with others?
No, I usually don’t share my phone because delivery apps and payment apps are logged in. Sometimes I give it to my wife to make a call, but not for long.
Q3. What apps and features do you frequently use?
I mostly use delivery apps, Google Maps, phone calls, WhatsApp, UPI apps, and the camera to upload delivery proof photos. I also use YouTube for time pass.
Q4. Do you read app permissions before allowing them?
Sometimes I read, but not fully. If the app is needed for work, I allow permissions like location and camera. Otherwise, I don’t think much.
Q5. How do you decide whether an app is safe to use?
If the company I work for asks me to use it, I trust it. I also trust apps that many other delivery boys use. I don’t install random apps.
Q6. Have you ever deleted messages, photos, or apps for privacy?
Yes, I delete delivery photos after some days. I also delete WhatsApp chats and videos when storage gets full.
Q7. What do you do before giving your phone for repair?
I log out of delivery apps and UPI apps. I remove the SIM card. I don’t know how to delete everything properly, so I feel worried.
Q8. Have you asked someone for help with phone problems?
Yes, I ask other delivery boys or go to a mobile shop. Sometimes I watch YouTube videos to fix issues.
Q9. Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
I trust my wife and sometimes my supervisor. I don’t share personal details with customers.
Q10. Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?
Yes, I save customer numbers with short names or order numbers so others don’t understand.
Q11. Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?
Yes, I helped a new delivery boy install delivery and navigation apps. I showed him basic use but not about permissions.
Q12. Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, microphone, or location?
I know location can be turned off, but I don’t know much about camera or microphone settings.
Q13. What do you do when you get warning messages on your phone?
I get confused and sometimes scared. I usually ignore them or ask another delivery boy what to do.
Q14. What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
I think the app can see those things. I don’t know if they save them somewhere else.
Q15. Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
Yes, because payment apps and personal photos are there. I feel uncomfortable.
Q16. Has a repair person ever opened your photos or apps without asking?
Once, a repair person opened my phone to check storage. I didn’t like it but didn’t stop him.
Q17. Do you use a lock screen on your phone?
Yes, I use fingerprint and PIN. Without lock, anyone can misuse payment apps.
Q18. Do you think local apps are safer than international ones?
I don’t know much about that. I use apps that my company or friends recommend.
Q19. Who do you turn to when you don’t understand phone settings?
I ask my friends or other delivery boys. Sometimes I search on YouTube.
Q20. Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?
Yes, other delivery boys warn me about fake calls, OTP frauds, and scams. I am careful because of that.
