Q1. What do you mainly use your phone for?
I use my phone mainly for calling customers, receiving tailoring orders, and WhatsApp messages. Customers send blouse designs or measurements on WhatsApp. Sometimes I watch stitching videos on YouTube to learn new designs.
Q2. Do you share your phone with others?
Yes, sometimes my wife uses my phone to make calls. My children also take it to watch videos. I tell them not to open my WhatsApp chats because customer messages are there.
Q3. What apps and features do you frequently use?
I mostly use WhatsApp, phone calls, and YouTube. I also use the camera to take photos of finished clothes. I don’t use many other apps.
Q4. Do you read app permissions before allowing them?
No, I don’t read them. I cannot understand those words. If the app is not working, I just press “Allow”.
Q5. How do you decide whether an app is safe to use?
If my friends or other tailors use it, then I trust it. Sometimes my son installs apps for me. I don’t download apps by myself much.
Q6. Have you ever deleted messages, photos, or apps for privacy?
Yes, I delete customer photos after work is finished. Sometimes I delete chats if my wife asks why customers are messaging late.
Q7. What do you do before giving your phone for repair?
I remove the SIM card and memory card. I also delete some photos. I don’t know how to remove everything, so I feel worried.
Q8. Have you asked someone for help with phone problems?
Yes, my son or a nearby mobile shop person helps me. I feel a little uncomfortable because they can see my photos and messages, but I don’t have a choice.
Q9. Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
I trust my wife and my son. I don’t share personal matters with customers or strangers on the phone.
Q10. Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?
Yes, I save customer names like “Blouse Order” or “Pant Work” so others don’t understand who they are.
Q11. Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?
I helped another tailor use WhatsApp. I only showed him how to send photos. I didn’t explain anything about permissions.
Q12. Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, microphone, or location?
No, I don’t know how to do that. I didn’t know it was possible.
Q13. What do you do when you get warning messages on your phone?
I get scared and close the phone. I usually show it to my son or ask the shop person.
Q14. What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
I think the app can see those things. I don’t know if it saves them somewhere else.
Q15. Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
Yes, because customer photos and family pictures are there. I worry someone might see or copy them.
Q16. Has a repair person ever opened your photos or apps without asking?
Once the repair person opened my gallery and said storage is full. I didn’t like it, but I didn’t say anything.
Q17. Do you use a lock screen on your phone?
Yes, I use a pattern lock. My wife also knows it. Without lock, anyone can open the phone.
Q18. Do you think local apps are safer than international ones?
I don’t know about local or foreign. I use whatever works and what others recommend.
Q19. Who do you turn to when you don’t understand phone settings?
My son or sometimes another tailor who knows phones better.
Q20. Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?
Yes, my son and friends tell me not to answer unknown calls and not to share OTP. I follow that.
