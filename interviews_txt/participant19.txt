Q1: What do you mainly use your phone for?
A: I mostly use my phone for calling my husband and family members. Sometimes I check WhatsApp for family groups, and my children show me videos on YouTube. I don’t know much beyond that.
Q2: Do you share your phone with others?
A: Yes, my children use it more than me. They watch cartoons or school videos. My husband also uses it sometimes when he is home. I don’t mind, but I can’t stop them even if I want to.
Section 2: Awareness and Perceptions
Q3: What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?
A: I don’t use many apps. I like WhatsApp because I can send voice messages. I don’t think much about what these apps take from my phone. I just use what my brother installed.
Q4: When an app asks for permission like access to location, camera, or contacts, do you read and understand what it means?
A: No, I just click “Allow” if it doesn’t open. I don’t understand what it means. Sometimes my son helps me.
Q5: How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?
A: I don’t install apps myself. My brother or children do it for me. If they say it’s okay, then I believe it’s safe.
Section 3: Practices and Behaviors
Q6: Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?
A: No, I don’t know how to delete things. My children sometimes delete photos to make space.
Q7: If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?
A: I just give it. I don’t delete anything. I trust the shopkeeper in the nearby town. He is known to us.
Q8: Have you ever asked someone to help you with a phone problem?
A: Yes, many times. I ask my children or my younger brother. I don’t think too much about them seeing my messages or photos.
Section 4: Trust and Sharing
Q9: Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
A: I only talk to my husband in person. I don’t use the phone for such things.
Q10: Have you used code words, nicknames, or indirect language to keep something private?
A: No, I speak directly. If something is private, I say it quietly or talk when others are not around.
Section 5: Digital Literacy and Consent
Q11: Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?
A: No, I ask for help myself. I don’t know how to install apps or explain them to others.
Q12: Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, mic, or location?
A: No, I don’t know that. I have never tried to do it.
Q13: When you get a warning message like “this app may harm your phone,” what do you do?
A: I get scared. I close the phone and wait for someone to check. Usually my son helps.
Q14: What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
A: I don’t really know. I didn’t think about it. I thought it’s just to make the app work.
Section 6: Privacy and Repair
Q15: Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
A: No, I didn’t think like that. I just hand over the phone and say “please fix it.”
Q16: Has a repair person, friend, or shopkeeper ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?
A: I don’t know if they did. I don’t check after giving. But they are people we know, so I hope they didn’t.
Q17: Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?
A: No, I don’t have a lock. My children use the phone too, and they will forget the password.
Section 7: Trust and Social Influence
Q18: Do you think apps from local developers are safer than international ones? Why?
A: I don’t know the difference. I use whatever is already there on the phone.
Q19: Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?
A: My children or my brother. They do it quickly. I just watch.
Q20: Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?
A: My brother once told me not to click unknown links. Apart from that, I don’t know much about safety.
