Q1: What do you mainly use your phone for?
A: Mostly, I use my phone for calling family and friends, and sometimes texting. I also use WhatsApp to talk to suppliers and customers. I watch videos occasionally to relax but don’t do much else on the phone.
Q2: Do you share your phone with others? If yes, with whom and how often?
A: Yes, my husband and sometimes my son use the phone too, especially when they want to make a call or watch videos. Sharing happens daily but mostly when I’m not using it.
Q3: What are your favorite apps or features on your phone? Why do you use those apps? Have you thought about what information they might be collecting?
A: I mostly use WhatsApp because it helps me stay connected with my customers and family. I also use YouTube for watching cooking videos. I don’t think much about what data these apps collect; I trust them because they are popular.
Q4: When an app asks for permission, like to access your location, camera, or contacts, do you read and understand what it means?
A: No, I don’t usually read the permissions carefully. If the app seems useful, I just click ‘Allow’ because I want the app to work.
Q5: How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?
A: I trust apps that many people I know use or apps recommended by shopkeepers or friends. If the app looks confusing, I avoid it.
Q6: Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?
A: Yes, sometimes I delete messages from WhatsApp if they are personal or from suppliers I don’t want others to see. I don’t usually delete apps because I don’t have many.
Q7: If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?
A: I don’t really do anything before giving it for repair. I just give the phone as it is because I don’t know how to delete or back up data.
Q8: Have you ever asked someone (friend/repairer/child) to help you with a phone problem? How did you feel about them seeing your personal data?
A: Yes, I ask my son or a repair shop person to help me. I feel a little uncomfortable but trust them because they are close or professionals.
Q9: Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
A: I trust my husband and close family the most. I try to avoid sharing sensitive info over the phone or apps.
Q10: Have you used code words, nicknames, or indirect language to keep something private?
A: No, I don’t usually do that. I just try not to talk about private things on the phone.
Q11: Have you ever helped someone install or use an app? What did you explain to them?
A: Sometimes I help my neighbors install WhatsApp. I tell them how to send messages but don’t explain much about privacy or permissions.
Q12: Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, microphone, or location?
A: No, I don’t know how to do that. I don’t go into settings much.
Q13: When you get a warning message (e.g., “this app may harm your phone”), what do you usually do?
A: I don’t understand those messages well. Sometimes I ignore them or ask my son what to do.
Q14: What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
A: I think the app can see my contacts and maybe send messages, but I’m not sure if it uses the info for anything else.
Q15: Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
A: Sometimes I worry a little but usually still take it because I need it fixed.
Q16: Has a repair person, friend, or shopkeeper ever opened your gallery or apps without asking? How did you feel?
A: Yes, once the repair person looked through my photos without asking. I felt bad but didn’t say anything because I needed the repair.
Q17: Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not? Does anyone else know your password?
A: I don’t use any password because I find it hard to remember. My husband sometimes uses my phone when I ask him.
Q18: Do you think apps from local developers are safer than international ones? Why?
A: I think local apps might be better because they understand our language and culture.
Q19: Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?
A: I ask my son or sometimes a shopkeeper for help.
Q20: Do people around you influence the way you think about online safety?
A: Yes, my family tells me to be careful with unknown calls or messages. That helps me stay alert.
