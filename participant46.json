    {"question": "What do you mainly use your phone for?", "answer": "I use my phone mainly for delivery work. I use delivery apps to accept orders, check addresses, call customers, and confirm deliveries. I also use Google Maps for navigation. Apart from work, I use WhatsApp, YouTube, and sometimes Facebook."},
    {"question": "Do you share your phone with others?", "answer": "No, I usually don’t share my phone because delivery apps and payment apps are logged in. Sometimes I give it to my wife to make a call, but not for long."},
    {"question": "What apps and features do you frequently use?", "answer": "I mostly use delivery apps, Google Maps, phone calls, WhatsApp, UPI apps, and the camera to upload delivery proof photos. I also use YouTube for time pass."},
    {"question": "Do you read app permissions before allowing them?", "answer": "Sometimes I read, but not fully. If the app is needed for work, I allow permissions like location and camera. Otherwise, I don’t think much."},
    {"question": "How do you decide whether an app is safe to use?", "answer": "If the company I work for asks me to use it, I trust it. I also trust apps that many other delivery boys use. I don’t install random apps."},
    {"question": "Have you ever deleted messages, photos, or apps for privacy?", "answer": "Yes, I delete delivery photos after some days. I also delete WhatsApp chats and videos when storage gets full."},
    {"question": "What do you do before giving your phone for repair?", "answer": "I log out of delivery apps and UPI apps. I remove the SIM card. I don’t know how to delete everything properly, so I feel worried."},
    {"question": "Have you asked someone for help with phone problems?", "answer": "Yes, I ask other delivery boys or go to a mobile shop. Sometimes I watch YouTube videos to fix issues."},
    {"question": "Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?", "answer": "I trust my wife and sometimes my supervisor. I don’t share personal details with customers."},
    {"question": "Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?", "answer": "Yes, I save customer numbers with short names or order numbers so others don’t understand."},
    {"question": "Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?", "answer": "Yes, I helped a new delivery boy install delivery and navigation apps. I showed him basic use but not about permissions."},
    {"question": "Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, microphone, or location?", "answer": "I know location can be turned off, but I don’t know much about camera or microphone settings."},
    {"question": "What do you do when you get warning messages on your phone?", "answer": "I get confused and sometimes scared. I usually ignore them or ask another delivery boy what to do."},
    {"question": "What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?", "answer": "I think the app can see those things. I don’t know if they save them somewhere else."},
    {"question": "Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?", "answer": "Yes, because payment apps and personal photos are there. I feel uncomfortable."},
    {"question": "Has a repair person ever opened your photos or apps without asking?", "answer": "Once, a repair person opened my phone to check storage. I didn’t like it but didn’t stop him."},
    {"question": "Do you use a lock screen on your phone?", "answer": "Yes, I use fingerprint and PIN. Without lock, anyone can misuse payment apps."},
    {"question": "Do you think local apps are safer than international ones?", "answer": "I don’t know much about that. I use apps that my company or friends recommend."},
    {"question": "Who do you turn to when you don’t understand phone settings?", "answer": "I ask my friends or other delivery boys. Sometimes I search on YouTube."},
    {"question": "Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?", "answer": "Yes, other delivery boys warn me about fake calls, OTP frauds, and scams. I am careful because of that."}
