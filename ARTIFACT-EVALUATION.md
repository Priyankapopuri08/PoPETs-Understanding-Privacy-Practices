Requested Badge: **Available**

## Description
This repository contains 50 interview transcripts collected and analyzed for the 2026 Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS 26) paper titled *“I Just Press Allow”: Understanding Privacy Practices of New Internet Users in Urban India*. 

The `interviews_1/` folder contains 50 files, each named using a unique identifier assigned to a specific participant (for instance, "P1" or "Participant 1"). Before viewing the dataset, we recommend reading the paper for an understanding of the research questions and interview protocol.

### Security/Privacy Issues and Ethical Concerns (All badges)

In the absence of a formal ethics board/IRB for human-subjects research at our university, we followed established ICTD ethical research guidelines as outlined by Dearden et al.,[1](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3287098.3287134).

Participants were informed that:

1. Participation is voluntary.
2. They may withdraw anytime without consequence.
3. Responses will be anonymized and used only for research.
4. Anonymized transcripts and structured responses may be publicly published for non-commercial research use, with no personal identifiers linked to the dataset.

With permission from the participants, interviews and audio recordings were collected, transcribed, and fully de-identified (removing names, phone numbers).

## Environment 
Each transcript is stored as a .txt file, which can be easily opened by any text-editing or word-processing application. The overall size of the dataset is about 330KB.
