Requested Badge: **Available**

## Description
This repository contains 50 interview transcripts collected and analyzed for the 2026 Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS 26) paper titled *“I Just Press Allow”: Understanding Privacy Practices of New Internet*. 

The `interviews_1/` folder contains 50 files, each named using a unique identifier assigned to a specific participant (for instance, "P1" or "Participant 1"). Before viewing the dataset, we recommend reading the paper for an understanding of the research questions and interview protocol.

### Security/Privacy Issues and Ethical Concerns (All badges)
The dataset comprises transcripts of responses provided by participants. We took great care to ensure the confidentiality of the study participants. All participants provided their informed consent before we collected any personal information. 

All findings were rigorously de-identified and anonymized to ensure that the disclosure of interviewee affiliations or the reidentification of participants would be mitigated, thereby minimizing potential harm upon the public release of the redacted interview transcripts. 

## Environment 
Each transcript is stored as a .txt file, which can be easily opened by any text-editing or word-processing application. The overall size of the dataset is about 330KB.
