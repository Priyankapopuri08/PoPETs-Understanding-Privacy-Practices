P9, tailor, Age: 44 years, Education: 5th class
Mostly for calling my daughter who works in Delhi, and sometimes for WhatsApp messages with relatives. I also use it to watch sewing videos on YouTube when my son shows me how.
Yes, I share it with my son and sometimes my husband. My son uses it to help me with apps or watch cricket. My husband uses it to call his brother.
WhatsApp is my favorite. It helps me stay in touch with my daughter. I also like YouTube because I can see sewing patterns. I don’t really think about what these apps take from my phone.
No, I don’t understand. I just click ‘yes’, or my son helps me. Sometimes I get scared when too many things pop up.
If my son installs it or tells me it’s okay, I trust it. I don’t know how to check otherwise.
Once I deleted a message from a neighbor who kept texting, because I didn’t want any misunderstanding with my husband.
I remove the memory card if I remember. I don’t know how to delete things, so I just give it as it is. I feel worried, but I don’t know how to clean it.
Yes, my son. He helps when something is not working. I feel okay because I trust him, but I don’t like others checking my phone.
I only share personal things face-to-face. I don’t like writing anything private on the phone.
Yes, sometimes I say “the sweet one” when referring to my daughter’s boyfriend, so my husband doesn’t know.
No, I need to help myself. My son helps me, but I don’t help others.
No, I’ve never done that. I didn’t even know it could be done.
I get scared. I ask my son or just close the app.
I think they use it to show my photo in the app. I don’t know if they store it.
Yes. I waited two weeks once because I had personal photos and didn’t know how to delete them.
A shop guy once looked at my photos and laughed. I felt angry but didn’t say anything because I was scared.
No, I find it confusing. My son set it once but I forgot it.
I don’t know the difference. I use what my son installs.
Always my son. He knows everything about phones.
Yes. My niece once told me not to open strange messages. I follow what they say.
Scenarios
Scenario 1: Broken Phone
I ask my son to remove some photos, but mostly I leave them as it is because I don’t know how.
Scenario 2: Sharing a Phone with Family
I ask him to give it back. I sometimes delete messages quickly if I feel uncomfortable.

Scenario 4: Helping an Elderly Relative
I don’t help, but I ask my son to help them.
Scenario 5: Using a Borrowed Phone
I pretend I didn’t see anything. It’s not right to look at someone’s things.
Scenario 6: Selling or Giving Away a Phone
I would take out the SIM and memory card. That’s all I know.
Scenario 7: Cloud Backup Surprise:
I don’t understand cloud. If it happens, I’d be shocked and ask my son to fix it.

No, I don’t know how to use public WiFi. My son told me it’s risky.

No, I don’t believe them. My niece told me about scams like this.
