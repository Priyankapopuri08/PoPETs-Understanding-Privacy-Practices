Q1: What do you mainly use your phone for?
A.I use it to chat with friends on WhatsApp and Snapchat, watch reels on Instagram, and sometimes attend online classes.
Q2: Do you share your phone with others?
A.No. It’s my personal phone. But my younger brother sometimes takes it to play games.
Q3: What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?
A.Snapchat, WhatsApp, Instagram. I don’t really think about data. I just click ‘Allow’. My friends do the same.
Q4: When an app asks for permission, like access to location or contacts, do you read and understand what it means?
A.No. I skip all that to use the app quickly.
Q5: How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?
A.If my friends use it or if it’s popular on the Play Store, I trust it.
Q6: Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?
A.Yes, especially when I have chats I don’t want my brother to see. I also delete screenshots and messages from Snapchat.
Q7: If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?
A.I give it to a nearby repair shop. I try to delete chats first, but if the screen is broken, I just give it as is.
Q8: Have you ever asked someone to help you with a phone problem?
A.Yes, I ask my cousin. I feel awkward if he sees my photos, so I hide the gallery app.
Q9: Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
A.Only my best friend. I avoid sharing sensitive stuff on group chats.
Q10: Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?
A.Yes! On Snapchat, we use emojis and short names to hide meaning from others.
Q11: Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?
A.Yes, I helped my aunt install a health app and showed her how to make payments on PhonePe.
Q12: Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera or location?
A.I just found out my friend showed me how to go to settings.
Q13: When you get a warning message (“this app may harm your phone”), what do you usually do?
A.If I really need it, I install it anyway. Otherwise, I ignore it.
Q14: What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
A.I think it just helps me share things faster. I didn’t know they keep it or stored it elsewhere.
Q15: Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
A.Yes. I felt embarrassed about the chats and photos, but I needed to fix it.
Q16: Has a repair person ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?
A.Yes, my cousin once. I got angry and added a fingerprint lock.
Q17: Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?
A.Yes, fingerprint and pattern both. I don’t want anyone checking my phone.
Q18: Do you think local apps are safer than international ones? Why?
A.I don’t know. I just use what’s trending.
Q19: Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?
A.My cousin sometimes searches YouTube.
Q20: Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?
A.Yes, my friends tell me not to use random links. We talk about scams sometimes.
Scenarios:
Scenario 1: Broken Phone
I try to delete chats and pictures first. If the phone is dead, I feel scared they’ll check everything.
Scenario 2: Sharing a Phone with Family
If my brother borrows it, I close all chats and hide Snapchat. I don’t want him teasing me.

If it looks fun, I install it. I click ‘Allow’ without checking. Later, I will remove it if it bothers me.
Scenario 4: Helping an Elderly Relative
I installed a government pension app for my grandmother. I didn’t explain much — just said ‘click here.’
