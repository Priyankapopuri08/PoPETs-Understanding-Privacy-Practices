Q1. What do you mainly use your phone for?
I mainly use my phone for calling the shop owner, customers, and family members. Sometimes customers call to ask if items are available. I also use WhatsApp to receive messages about work timings or payments. In the evening, I watch YouTube videos for entertainment and news.
Q2. Do you share your phone with others?
Yes, I share my phone with my wife and sometimes with my children. They use it to make calls or watch videos. I don’t mind sharing because we are family, but I feel uneasy if someone else uses it.
Q3. What apps and features do you frequently use?
I mostly use phone calls, WhatsApp, YouTube, and the camera. I use the camera to take photos of shop items if the owner asks. I don’t use many other apps because I don’t understand them well.
Q4. Do you read app permissions before allowing them?
No, I don’t read them. I cannot understand English properly. When the phone asks for permission, I just press “Allow” so the app works.
Q5. How do you decide whether an app is safe to use?
If the shop owner, my friends, or my children say it is okay, then I use it. I don’t download apps on my own. Usually, someone else installs them for me.
Q6. Have you ever deleted messages, photos, or apps for privacy?
Yes, I delete photos after work is done, especially if they are related to customers or shop items. I also delete WhatsApp messages sometimes when my phone storage becomes full.
Q7. What do you do before giving your phone for repair?
I remove the SIM card and memory card. I don’t know how to delete everything properly, so I just hope the repair person does not check my personal photos or messages.
Q8. Have you asked someone for help with phone problems?
Yes, I usually ask my children or the shop owner. Sometimes I go to a local mobile repair shop. I feel worried because they can see my phone, but I don’t have any other option.
Q9. Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
I trust my wife and children. I don’t trust strangers or people from the shop with personal matters.
Q10. Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?
Yes, I save some contacts with short names so others don’t understand who they are. For example, I don’t save full names.
Q11. Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?
I helped my wife learn how to answer WhatsApp calls and send voice messages. I didn’t explain permissions because I don’t understand them myself.
Q12. Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, microphone, or location?
No, I don’t know how to do that. I didn’t know apps could use those things without opening them.
Q13. What do you do when you get warning messages on your phone?
I get scared and close the message. I usually show it to my children or ask someone who knows phones better.
Q14. What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
I think the app can see those photos or contacts. I don’t know what happens after that.
Q15. Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
Yes, because family photos and WhatsApp messages are there. I worry someone might look at them.
Q16. Has a repair person ever opened your photos or apps without asking?
Once, the repair person opened my gallery saying storage is full. I felt uncomfortable but didn’t say anything.
Q17. Do you use a lock screen on your phone?
Yes, I use a pattern lock. My wife and children also know it.
Q18. Do you think local apps are safer than international ones?
I don’t know the difference. I use whatever apps others tell me to use.
Q19. Who do you turn to when you don’t understand phone settings?
I ask my children or sometimes the shop owner.
Q20. Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?
Yes, my children tell me not to share OTPs and not to answer unknown calls. I follow what they say.
