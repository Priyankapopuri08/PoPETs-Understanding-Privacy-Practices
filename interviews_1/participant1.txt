P1, House helper, Age: 36 years, Education: 3rd class
I have been using my phone for 6 years. The phone I am using is a common phone that my husband and I will use. My children have their own phones. I use the phone for 2 to 3 hours.
Q1: What do you mainly use your phone for?
A.I mainly use the phone for calling and to send WhatsApp messages. I don’t have time to watch videos, but when my children show  them then I will try to learn how to use Instagram. I don’t know how to check the balance. I will check using the messaging app.
Q2: Do you share your phone with others?
A.I share my phone with my husband.
Q3: What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?
A.I use WhatsApp and YouTube on my phone. I will send messages and photos to my sister. I will talk about my relatives. I am learning how to use Instagram from my children. I don’t know about apps collecting the information.
Q4: When an app asks for permission, like access to location or contacts, do you read and understand what it means?
A.I will give permission to all the apps. Generally, I don’t download the apps. My children will do all the installations.
Q5: How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?
A.I use only WhatsApp because everyone of my family members are using it to talk with each other.
Q6: Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?
A.I deleted messages from the phone because my husband scolds me if he sees me talking to my relatives and wasting time. I will delete a few pictures also to avoid fights with them.
Q7: If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?
A.I will go to the local repair shop to give my phone. I will tell them the lock of my phone. I did not delete anything from my phone. I know they will take pictures, but I have to tell them the lock for the phone.
Q8: Have you ever asked someone to help you with a phone problem?
A.I don’t have any problem asking for help, but only from known people. I don’t like them seeing personal photos, so I delete them. I don’t feel good if others see the information.
Q9: Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
A.I will trust the people whom I know to share any information, either by phone or directly. I will send the information via SMS or WhatsApp, or by talking in person.
Q10: Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?
A.I never use any code words or indirect language to keep something secret.
Q11: Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?
A.I don’t know how to install apps. So I can’t help anyone downloading the apps.
Q12: Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera or location?
A.I don’t know how to stop apps from using the camera, microphone, or anything.
Q13: When you get a warning message (“this app may harm your phone”), what do you usually do?
A.If the app is important to use, then I will download the app. Otherwise, my children will download the app.

A.I don’t have any idea about all of it.
Q15: Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?

Q16: Has a repair person ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?
A.They might have opened the apps like Photos or Instagram. But I don’t have so many secrets.
Q17: Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?
A.Yes, I have a lock on my phone. My husband knows the lock. If I lose my phone, then others should not open it.

Scenarios:
Scenario 1: Broken Phone
I go to the local repair shop nearby. I don’t delete anything because I don’t know how. I just tell them the phone’s password if they need it. I know they might check photos, but I have no choice. I just hope they don’t misuse it.
Scenario 2: Sharing a Phone with Family
Yes, I share my phone with my husband. If there are messages from my sister or relatives that he might not like, I delete them. Otherwise, it becomes a reason for arguments. I don’t want to fight, so I remove those messages or pictures.
Scenario 3: Installing a New App
I don’t install apps by myself. My children do it. I don’t know what access it asks. If they say it’s safe, I say yes. Otherwise, I don’t use any new app unless it is necessary.
Scenario 4: Helping an Elderly Relative
Actually, I myself ask for help from my children. I don’t know how to install apps or what permissions mean, so I cannot help someone else. If they ask me, I will ask my children to help us both.
Scenario 5: Using a Borrowed Phone
I will not say anything. That is their private matter. Even if I see something by mistake, I will ignore it. I don’t like to interfere in others’ phones and expect the same from them.
Scenario 6: Selling or Giving Away a Phone
I have not given out any old phones yet. But if I have to give, I will remove my SIM and memory card. I don’t know how to delete everything, but I can ask my children to do it.
Scenario 7: Cloud Backup Surprise:
I don’t know about Google Photos or iCloud. If deleted photos come back, I will feel scared and surprised. I think my phone is not safe. I will ask my children what happened.
Scenario 8: Using Free Public WiFi:
I don’t use WiFi or check the bank like that. I only check my balance through the message that comes to my phone. I don’t use apps for banking. And I never connect to free WiFi—I don’t know how and I don’t trust it.
Scenario 9: Receiving a lottery:
No, I will not give any details. I don’t trust such calls. I have seen on TV and WhatsApp that people lose money like that. Even if they say I won, I will first ask my children. If they say it’s fake, I will block the number.
Scenario 10: Sharing account details:
If the person is close and I trust them fully, I might transfer a small amount, but only if my children help me. I don’t know how to send money myself. If I’m unsure or don’t understand what’s happening, I won’t do it. I don’t want to make any mistakes.
