Q1. What do you mainly use your phone for?
I use my phone mainly for online classes, college-related communication, and studying. I attend Zoom and Google Meet lectures, access Google Classroom, and read PDFs. I also use WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, and sometimes Netflix for relaxation.
Q2. Do you share your phone with others?
No, I usually don’t share my phone. Sometimes my mother might ask to make a call, but I don’t give my phone for regular use because it has college apps and personal chats.
Q3. What apps and features do you frequently use?
I use WhatsApp, Google Classroom, Google Drive, Gmail, Zoom, YouTube, Instagram, and a few note-taking apps. I also use UPI apps for small payments.
Q4. Do you read app permissions before allowing them?
Yes, I usually read them. If an app asks for permissions that don’t make sense, like contacts or microphone access for a simple app, I deny it.
Q5. How do you decide whether an app is safe to use?
I check reviews, ratings, and who developed the app. I also look at permission requirements. If it’s recommended by college or friends, I feel more confident.
Q6. Have you ever deleted messages, photos, or apps for privacy?
Yes, I regularly delete old chats, screenshots, and apps I no longer use. I also clear private photos or documents after submitting assignments.
Q7. What do you do before giving your phone for repair?
I back up my data, log out of important apps, and remove my Google account if possible. I prefer authorized service centers and avoid local shops.
Q8. Have you asked someone for help with phone problems?
Yes, I ask my classmates, seniors, or sometimes check YouTube tutorials. I feel more comfortable fixing issues myself if possible.
Q9. Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
I trust my parents and very close friends. I don’t share sensitive information over WhatsApp unless it’s really necessary.
Q10. Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?
Yes, sometimes my friends and I use initials or emojis in group chats so others won’t understand if they see the messages.
Q11. Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?
Yes, I have helped my parents and grandparents install WhatsApp, UPI apps, and video call apps. I explain basic usage and also warn them about scams.
Q12. Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, microphone, or location?
Yes, I go to app settings and manage permissions. I often restrict background location and microphone access.
Q13. What do you do when you get warning messages on your phone?
I take them seriously. I usually uninstall the app or search online to confirm if it’s safe.
Q14. What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
I think the app can read and store that data and possibly sync it to their servers. That’s why I’m careful with permissions.
Q15. Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
Yes, I hesitate if I haven’t backed up or cleaned my phone. I make sure personal data is protected first.
Q16. Has a repair person ever opened your photos or apps without asking?
No, not so far. I usually stay nearby when repairs are being done.
Q17. Do you use a lock screen on your phone?
Yes, I use fingerprint and PIN. I also lock some apps like WhatsApp and UPI with extra security.
Q18. Do you think local apps are safer than international ones?
Not necessarily. I think safety depends more on the developer and privacy practices than the country.
Q19. Who do you turn to when you don’t understand phone settings?
I usually search online or watch YouTube tutorials. Sometimes I ask my friends from college.
Q20. Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?
Yes, my friends and college seniors often share information about scams, data leaks, and privacy settings, which helps me stay careful.
