P20, B.Com Student + Part-time delivery work, Age: 22 years
Q1: What do you mainly use your phone for?
A: I mostly use it for WhatsApp, Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube. I also use it to check my bank account and pay through UPI when I do deliveries. I chat with friends and watch reels a lot too.
Q2: Do you share your phone with others?
A: Not really. I’m very particular about my phone. Sometimes my younger brother plays games on it, but I don’t like others checking my chats or photos.
Section 2: Awareness and Perceptions
Q3: What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?
A: I like Instagram for reels and chatting, and I use Snapchat for streaks with friends. I also use PhonePe a lot. I know these apps may take data, but I’ve never checked what exactly.
Q4: When an app asks for permission like access to location, camera, or contacts, do you read and understand what it means?
A: Honestly, I just allow it if I want to use the app. Sometimes I click “only while using the app,” but I don’t fully read all that.
Q5: How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?
A: I check the ratings on the Play Store. If many people use it, I trust it. Also, if my friends use it, then I install it too.
Section 3: Practices and Behaviors
Q6: Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?
A: Yes, sometimes I delete chats from Snapchat or WhatsApp, especially if it’s personal or flirty. Just to be safe.
Q7: If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?
A: I remove my SIM and log out of banking apps. I try to delete photos and clear WhatsApp, or at least hide things in a secure folder.
Q8: Have you ever asked someone to help you with a phone problem?
A: Yes, a friend who knows more about phones. I feel okay because I trust him, but I still close my gallery and chats first.
Section 4: Trust and Sharing
Q9: Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
A: Only close friends in person. I avoid discussing serious stuff on apps. For banking, I use official apps, not random links.
Q10: Have you used code words, nicknames, or indirect language to keep something private?
A: Yes, we use emojis or slang in group chats so others won’t understand if they see it. Like “project” for a date or “box” for money.
Section 5: Digital Literacy and Consent
Q11: Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?
A: Yes, I’ve helped my mom install WhatsApp and PhonePe. I told her not to share OTPs and not to click on random links.
Q12: Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, mic, or location?
A: Yes, I know where the settings are in Android. I have disabled location for a few apps like Facebook.
Q13: When you get a warning message like “this app may harm your phone,” what do you do?
A: I don’t install it. If it shows a red warning, I delete it immediately. I’m cautious about unknown apps.
Q14: What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
A: I think it can use them for ads or show content based on that. I don’t think they sell it, but they definitely use it for suggestions.
Section 6: Privacy and Repair
Q15: Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
A: Yes, especially because of chats and photos. Once I delayed repair until I backed everything up and deleted private stuff.
Q16: Has a repair person, friend, or shopkeeper ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?
A: Once at a local shop, the guy opened my gallery while checking the camera. I didn’t like it and now I’m more careful.
Q17: Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?
A: Yes, fingerprint and PIN both. No one else knows it. It’s basic security. Without a lock, I feel exposed.
Section 7: Trust and Social Influence
Q18: Do you think apps from local developers are safer than international ones? Why?
A: Not really. I trust international ones more. Local ones sometimes look unprofessional and have bugs.
Q19: Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?
A: Usually I search on YouTube. Sometimes ask my cousin who’s into tech.
Q20: Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?
A: Yes, a friend once got scammed, so now we all warn each other about fake messages or lottery scams.
Scenarios
Scenario 1: Broken Phone
A: I’d remove the SIM, delete chats, and clear browser history before giving it for repair. I also log out of UPI apps.
Scenario 2: Sharing with Family
A: If my brother’s using my phone, I turn off notifications or enable Do Not Disturb. I don’t like private messages popping up.
Scenario 3: New App Requesting Permissions
A: I check what permissions it needs. If it asks too much for no reason, I don’t install it. Or I deny access after installation.
Scenario 4: Helping Elderly Relative
A: I’ve helped my uncle with WhatsApp and Aarogya Setu. I explain basics but not too much about permissions—just tell him to be careful.
Scenario 5: Using Someone Else’s Phone
A: If I see something personal, I ignore it. I don’t tell them. It’s better not to create awkwardness.
Scenario 6: Giving Away Phone
A: I would factory reset the phone and remove SD card. I don’t give my phone until I’m sure everything’s wiped.
Scenario 7: Cloud Backup Surprise
A: Yeah, it happened once. I deleted photos from the phone but they were still in Google Photos. I learned to delete from cloud too.
Scenario 8: Free Public WiFi
A: I avoid using public WiFi for banking. I use mobile data for that. If I have to connect, I don’t open sensitive apps.
Scenario 9: Lottery Call
A: I hang up. I know it’s a scam. No one gives free money just like that.
Scenario 10: Friend Needs Help
A: Depends on the friend. If it’s a real emergency and someone close, I’ll help and ask them to return it later. But I won’t share my UPI PIN or password.
