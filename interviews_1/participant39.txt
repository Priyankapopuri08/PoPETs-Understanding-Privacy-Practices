Q1: What do you mainly use your phone for?
A: I use my phone for chatting on WhatsApp and Snapchat, watching videos on YouTube and Instagram, online classes through Google Meet, and checking bank balance through my UPI app. I also use it for shopping on Flipkart or Amazon sometimes.
Q2: Do you share your phone with others?
A: Not much. Sometimes my younger cousin borrows it to play games, but I stay nearby. I don’t like giving it to others, especially when there are private chats or banking apps open.
Section 2: Awareness and Perceptions
Q3: What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?
A: I like Snapchat for sending funny videos and using filters. I also use YouTube a lot for tutorials and entertainment. I’m aware that apps may collect data, especially location and contacts, but I’m not always sure how much they actually take or where it goes.
Q4: When an app asks for permission, like to access your location or camera, do you read and understand what it means?
A: If it seems unnecessary—like a flashlight asking for location—I deny it. Otherwise, I allow it. I understand most permissions, but sometimes I just go with the flow if it’s a popular app.
Q5: How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?
A: If it’s highly rated on Play Store, has lots of downloads, and friends use it, I consider it safe. Also, if it’s in English and looks professional, I trust it more.
Section 3: Practices and Behaviors
Q6: Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?
A: Yes. I’ve deleted private chats or screenshots from Snapchat before anyone could see them. Sometimes even memes, just to avoid awkward explanations.
Q7: If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?
A: I remove my SIM card, sign out of my banking apps, and delete photos that I don’t want anyone to see. I’ve heard stories about data leaks from repair shops.
Q8: Have you ever asked someone to help you with a phone problem?
A: Once or twice, I asked my tech-savvy friend about system update issues. But I made sure to close my chats and gallery first. I don’t like others checking my phone too much.
Section 4: Trust and Sharing
Q9: Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
A: I prefer talking in person if something is really sensitive—like bank stuff or family matters. Apps are risky unless it’s someone very close.
Q10: Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?
A: Yes, with friends on Snapchat or WhatsApp, we use initials or emojis as code names so others can’t understand easily if they see the chat.
Section 5: Digital Literacy and Consent
Q11: Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?
A: Yes, I’ve helped my aunt install Paytm. I explained how to do a transaction, but I didn’t go too deep into privacy permissions because she found it confusing.
Q12: Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, microphone, or location?
A: Yes, I go to app settings and disable permissions. I even did that for Facebook and Instagram after watching a YouTube video about privacy.
Q13: When you get a warning message (“this app may harm your phone”), what do you usually do?
A: I uninstall it immediately unless it’s something I really need and trust. I’d rather play it safe.
Q14: What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
A: I think it uses them to suggest friends or target ads. But I’m not sure if they store or sell the data. I’ve read about data leaks online.
Section 6: Privacy and Repair
Q15: Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
A: Yes. That’s why I try to do small repairs myself or use service centers I trust. I don’t want my photos or chats seen by strangers.
Q16: Has a repair person ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?
A: Not that I know of. But I lock my gallery app and banking apps just in case.
Q17: Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?
A: Yes, I use fingerprint and pattern lock. No one knows it. It’s basic security for me.
Section 7: Trust and Social Influence
Q18: Do you think local apps are safer than international ones? Why?
A: Not really. I think international apps are more secure. Local apps sometimes look shady or don’t follow proper safety practices.
Q19: Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?
A: I usually check YouTube tutorials or ask a friend from college who’s into tech.
Q20: Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?
A: Yes. One of my friends told me not to give permission to random apps and to use antivirus. I follow his advice sometimes.
Scenarios
Scenario 1: Broken Phone
A: I’d back up my files, delete personal stuff, sign out of apps, and reset the phone if I can. I’d avoid handing it over as is.
Scenario 2: Sharing with Family
A: If someone close is using my phone and I get a private message, I’ll quickly take the phone back or use message previews off. I’ve also hidden chats before.
Scenario 3: New App Requesting Permissions
A: If it asks too many permissions, I cancel it or check reviews. I don’t just click “Allow” blindly.
Scenario 4: Helping Elderly Relative
A: I’d install the app and try to explain basic usage. But I’m not sure they’ll understand permissions, so I’d set the permissions for them carefully.
Scenario 5: Using Someone Else’s Phone
A: If I see something private, I ignore it completely. I’d feel awkward saying anything. It’s best to respect their privacy.
Scenario 6: Giving Away Phone
A: I’d factory reset the phone and remove my Google account before giving it away.
Scenario 7: Cloud Backup Surprise
A: I’d be surprised and confused. Then I’d go online to learn how to delete things from Google Photos too.
Scenario 8: Free Public WiFi
A: I’ve connected once, but I didn’t do any banking. I’ve heard it’s risky. If I have to, I use VPN.
Scenario 9: Lottery Call
A: I know that’s fake. I just hang up. Never give details. Even my parents know this now.
Scenario 10: Friend Needs Help
A: I’d help if it’s someone close, but I’d confirm the details on call and do the transaction carefully. I won’t share OTP or login info.
