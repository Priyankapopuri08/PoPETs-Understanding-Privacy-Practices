Q1. What do you mainly use your phone for?
I use my phone for work-related communications, like emails, HRMS portals, Google Drive, and Zoom meetings. Personally, I use WhatsApp, Instagram, a bit of Netflix, and my banking apps. I manage team rosters and employee documents on secured cloud drives. My phone is a bridge between my personal and professional life.

Q2. Do you share your phone with others?
No, I do not share my phone. My husband might borrow it to make a call, but he knows not to open apps or notifications. Otherwise, it is strictly personal.

Q3. What apps and features do you frequently use?
WhatsApp, HRMS systems, Google Sheets, banking apps, and Instagram. I know they collect data, and I manage those permissions carefully. For HR documents, I use a secure vault app.

Q4. Do you read app permissions before allowing them?
Yes, I check permissions whenever I install something new, but I might skip a few for non-critical apps like photo editors.

Q5. How do you decide which apps to trust?
I trust apps with good reviews, known brands, and preferably those that are compliant with GDPR or Indian privacy standards.

Q6. Do you delete content for privacy reasons?
Yes, I delete sensitive employee documents, payslips, or any salary details after sending them. I also clear screenshots with confidential HR memos regularly.

Q7. What do you do before giving your phone for repair?
I back up my data, sign out of every HRMS app, delete financial apps, then wipe the device before going to an authorized Apple store. If I have no time to wipe, I postpone the repair.

Q8. Who do you ask for help with phone-related problems?
I will reach out to Apple support or my office IT team. I never ask random technicians.

Q9. Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
My husband and my office IT team. Beyond them, no one.

Q10. Have you used code words or nicknames to keep information private?
Yes, in HR messages, we use codes for employees or projects so that details are not easily exposed.

Q11. Have you helped others install or use apps?
Yes, I have helped junior staff install HR apps. I always explain about giving permission carefully, especially camera and microphone access.

Q12. Do you manage app permissions actively?
Yes, I monitor permissions and remove camera or mic access for apps I rarely use.

Q13. How do you respond to warning messages from apps?
I take them seriously. I verify them on the App Store or by asking IT.

Q14. What do you think happens when you allow access to contacts or media?
I know that when I allow contact or media access, those files could sync to external servers.

Q15. Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair due to privacy concerns?
Yes, because there is employee data on my phone. I never leave it without wiping or signing out of accounts.

Q16. Has anyone ever accessed your data during repair without permission?
No, because I take every step to wipe data first.

Q17. Do you use a lock screen or additional security?
Yes — Face ID, plus a 6-digit passcode, and my WhatsApp has an extra fingerprint lock.

Q18. Do you prefer local or foreign apps?
I use whichever app is transparent with its privacy policy and well-known. I do not blindly prefer local or foreign.

Q19. Who helps you when you don’t understand phone settings?
My husband and the office IT team.

Q20. Do people around you influence your online safety practices?
My office has cybersecurity trainings, which influence me a lot to follow proper practices.
