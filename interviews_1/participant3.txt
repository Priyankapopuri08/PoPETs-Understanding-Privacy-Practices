Q1: What do you mainly use your phone for?

Q2: Do you share your phone with others?

Q3: What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?
A.I use WhatsApp, YouTube, and sometimes Facebook. I didn’t know that apps collect information. I thought only what I send is seen.
Q4: When an app asks for permission, like access to location or contacts, do you read and understand what it means?
A.No, I just click "Allow" because otherwise the app won’t open. I don’t understand what it asks.
Q5: How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?

A.Yes, I delete old family chats and unwanted videos to keep space free. Once, I deleted some messages because my son scolded me for spending too much time talking.
Q7: If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?
A.I take it to the local repair shop. I don’t delete anything. They ask for my lock, and I give it. I feel a little nervous, but what to do?

A.Yes, my grandson helps me. I feel a bit shy when he sees my photos, but I know he won’t make fun.

A.I only talk to family on the phone or WhatsApp. If something important, I tell in person.
Q10: Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?
A.No, I speak clearly. But if it’s a money matter or something personal, I won’t tell over the phone.

No. I didn’t know you could do that.
Q12: Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera or location?
A.I leave it. I don’t open or download it. Sometimes I ask my son.
Q13: When you get a warning message (“this app may harm your phone”), what do you usually do?
A.I thought it was to help me send to others. I didn’t know they keep anything. Is it safe?
Q14: What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
A.Yes, but I have no choice. I delete some photos before going, especially family ones.

A.Yes, once the repairman opened my gallery. I didn’t like it, but I stayed quiet.
Q16: Has a repair person ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?
A.Yes, I use a PIN. My son set it up. Only my son and I know it.
Q17: Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?

Scenarios:
Scenario 1: Broken Phone
I give it to the same shop we go to for years. I feel scared they might see things, so I delete a few photos. But I still have to give the phone unlocked.
Scenario 2: Sharing a Phone with Family
I share with my husband. If my son calls while I’m talking to someone else, he gets upset. So I delete some chats if I think he won’t like it.
Scenario 3: Installing a New App
If the app says something confusing, I don’t open it. My son installs apps. I just use whatever he says is safe.
Scenario 4: Helping an Elderly Relative
If my sister asks, I call my grandson and he helps her. I don’t know how to explain apps or permissions.
Scenario 5: Using a Borrowed Phone
I won’t look at anything. Even if something opens by mistake, I ignore it. I don’t like when people do that to me, so I won’t do it to them.
Scenario 6: Selling or Giving Away a Phone
I will delete messages and remove SIM card. I don’t know how to delete everything. I’ll ask my son to format it.
Scenario 7: Cloud Backup Surprise:
One time, I deleted photos, but later saw them in Google Photos. I was shocked. I thought it was magic! My grandson explained cloud backup. I still don’t understand fully.
Scenario 8: Using Free Public WiFi:
I don’t connect to WiFi in shops or parks. My son said not to. I use mobile data, and only for WhatsApp and YouTube.
Scenario 9: Receiving a lottery:
I got such a call once. I didn’t give any details. I told them not to call again. My son said it was a scam.
Scenario 10: Sharing account details:
If someone I know well is in trouble, I’ll tell my son and he’ll help. I won’t send money myself because I don’t know how to do it safely.
