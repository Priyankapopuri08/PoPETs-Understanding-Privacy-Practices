P8, Home-based tailor, Age: 38 years, Education: 8th class
I use it for WhatsApp voice messages to my customers, to take pictures of clothes I stitch, and sometimes for YouTube sewing videos. My daughter helps me with new things.
Yes, my eldest daughter uses it for schoolwork, and my husband uses it if his phone isn’t working.
WhatsApp is useful for talking and sending stitched photos. YouTube gives me ideas for new designs. I don’t know what they take from my phone.
No, I just click “OK” because I don’t know what it means. I ask my daughter if something looks confusing.
If my daughter or sister-in-law uses it, then I also feel it’s okay.
Yes, I delete some WhatsApp messages if I think my husband will misunderstand.
I remove the memory card and hide some photos in another folder.
Yes, I always ask my daughter. I don’t mind her seeing messages or photos—she knows everything.
I only trust face-to-face. Even on the phone, I feel someone may be listening.
Yes, sometimes I say “blue cloth” when I mean something else in front of the kids.
I’ve shown another tailor how to send voice messages on WhatsApp.
No, my daughter might know.
I close the app and ask my daughter what to do.
Maybe it uses them to help me. I never thought they could go somewhere else.
Yes, once I waited for my daughter to delete some messages before we went.
I don’t know. I hope not. I never checked after repair.
No, it’s too confusing. I just keep the phone with me.
Maybe Indian ones are better because the language is easy.
My daughter or my niece.
Yes, my sister-in-law told me not to give bank details online.

Scenario 3: Installing a New App
