A: I trust close family members the most. I avoid sharing sensitive info with others.
Q10: Have you used code words, nicknames, or indirect language to keep something private?
A: Sometimes I use nicknames or slang with friends so others don’t understand.

Q16: Has a repair person, friend, or shopkeeper ever opened your gallery or apps without asking? How did you feel?
A: No, they have always asked me first. I feel respected when they do.
Q17: Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not? Does anyone else know your password?
A: Yes, I use a PIN lock. Only I know it.
Q18: Do you think apps from local developers are safer than international ones? Why?
