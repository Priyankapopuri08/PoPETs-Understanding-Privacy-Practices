Q1: What do you mainly use your phone for?
A: I mostly use my phone to talk to my family and friends through calls and WhatsApp messages. Sometimes I listen to music and watch small videos. I don’t use many apps because I don’t understand them well.
Q2: Do you share your phone with others? If yes, with whom and how often?
A: Yes, I share my phone with my husband and children sometimes. They use it to call relatives or watch videos. It happens a few times a week, especially when they need to check something quickly.
Q3: What are your favorite apps or features on your phone? Why do you use those apps? Have you ever thought about what information these apps might be collecting from your phone?
A: I like WhatsApp because it helps me talk to family far away. I also watch videos on YouTube. I don’t really think about what information these apps take; I just want to use them easily.
Q4: When an app asks for permission, like to access your location, camera, or contacts, do you read and understand what it means?
A: No, I usually just press “Allow” because the app won’t work without it. I don’t always read the messages or know what the permissions mean.
Q5: How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?
A: I trust apps that my family or neighbors use. If someone I know says it’s good, I use it. Otherwise, I don’t open many new apps.
Q6: Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?
A: Sometimes I delete messages if they are private or from someone I don’t want others to know about. But I don’t hide apps because I don’t know how.
Q7: If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?
A: I usually just give the phone as it is. I feel worried that someone might see my photos or messages, but I don’t know how to remove them.
Q8: Have you ever asked someone (friend/repairer/child) to help you with a phone problem? How did you feel about them seeing your personal data?
A: Yes, I ask my son or the repair shop. I feel uncomfortable but I don’t have a choice. Sometimes I hope they don’t look at my private things.
Q9: Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
A: I trust talking in person with my family most. On the phone or apps, I avoid sharing very private things.
Q10: Have you used code words, nicknames, or indirect language to keep something private?
A: No, I don’t do that. I talk openly with people I trust.
Q11: Have you ever helped someone install or use an app? What did you explain to them?
A: No, I don’t feel confident to help others. My son sometimes helps me.
Q12: Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, microphone, or location?
A: No, I don’t know how to do that.
Q13: When you get a warning message (e.g., “this app may harm your phone”), what do you usually do?
A: I usually ignore the warning because I don’t understand it. Sometimes I uninstall the app if it stops working.
Q14: What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
A: I think the app uses them to help me share pictures or talk to people. I don’t know if they keep or share the data elsewhere.
Q15: Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
A: Yes, I worry about my photos and messages. But I don’t have many options.
Q16: Has a repair person, friend, or shopkeeper ever opened your gallery or apps without asking while using or fixing your phone? How did you feel?
A: Yes, once the repair person looked at my photos. I felt uncomfortable but didn’t say anything because I was shy.
Q17: Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not? Does anyone else know your password?
A: No, I don’t use a password because I find it hard to remember. Sometimes my husband uses my phone.
Q18: Do you think apps from local developers are safer than international ones? Why?
A: I don’t really think about that. If the app is in my language, I feel more comfortable.
Q19: Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?
A: I ask my son or neighbors for help.
Q20: Do people around you (family, friends, shopkeepers) influence the way you think about online safety?
A: Yes, they tell me to be careful and not to share passwords or click on strange links.
