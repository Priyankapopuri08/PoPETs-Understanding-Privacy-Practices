Q1: What do you mainly use your phone for?
A: I use my phone mostly for calling my children, listening to bhajans on YouTube, and talking to relatives on WhatsApp voice calls. Sometimes I see videos my granddaughter shows me.
Q2: Do you share your phone with others?
A: Yes, my husband uses it to make calls, and my granddaughter uses it for watching YouTube sometimes. We all use it together.
Section 2: Awareness and Perceptions
Q3: What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?
A: I like YouTube for listening to religious songs. I don’t know much about apps, but WhatsApp is easy to use for talking. I never thought about what they collect.
Q4: When an app asks for permission like access to location, camera, or contacts, do you read and understand what it means?
A: No, I just click on "yes" or whatever my granddaughter tells me. I don’t understand all that.
Q5: How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?
A: I don’t install anything myself. If someone I trust installs it, like my son, I use it.
Section 3: Practices and Behaviors
Q6: Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?
A: No, I don’t have anything like that. All my things are for family.
Q7: If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?
A: I don’t do anything. I give it as it is. I didn’t know you could remove anything.
Q8: Have you ever asked someone to help you with a phone problem?
A: Yes, my granddaughter or son helps. I don’t mind them seeing things. Everything in my phone is simple.
Section 4: Trust and Sharing
Q9: Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
A: I only tell things in person, never on the phone. I don’t share serious things on WhatsApp.
Q10: Have you used code words, nicknames, or indirect language to keep something private?
A: No, I don’t use anything like that. If I need to say something personal, I wait till I meet them.
Section 5: Digital Literacy and Consent
Q11: Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?
A: No, I get help instead of helping. I don’t know how to install anything.
Q12: Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, mic, or location?
A: No, I didn’t even know that’s possible.
Q13: When you get a warning message like “this app may harm your phone,” what do you do?
A: I get scared. I call my son or just leave it. I don’t know what to do with those messages.
Q14: What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
A: I don’t know. Maybe they need it to work. I never thought they might be taking something.
Section 6: Privacy and Repair
Q15: Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
A: No, there’s nothing private. I just give it to the shop in the town.
Q16: Has a repair person, friend, or shopkeeper ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?
A: I don’t know. Maybe they do, but I don’t mind because there’s nothing special.
Q17: Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?
A: No, it’s difficult for me. Then I forget it. Everyone in the house uses it, so we keep it open.
Section 7: Trust and Social Influence
Q18: Do you think apps from local developers are safer than international ones? Why?
A: I don’t know where the apps come from. I just use whatever my family installs.
Q19: Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?
A: My granddaughter or son. They know everything.
Q20: Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?
A: Yes, they tell me not to answer unknown calls and not to give OTPs. I follow what they say.
