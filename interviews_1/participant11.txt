Q1: What do you mainly use your phone for?
A: Mostly for calling my children and relatives. I use WhatsApp to see the photos my daughter sends. Sometimes I listen to devotional songs on YouTube, but only when my granddaughter helps me open the app.
Q2: Do you share your phone with others?
A: Yes, my granddaughter uses it to play games and watch cartoons when she visits. My husband also sometimes takes it to call someone if his phone is charging.
Q3: What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?
A: WhatsApp is my favorite because I get to see my family’s photos. I don’t really think about what the apps collect. My daughter once told me not to click on anything new.
Q4: When an app asks for permission, like access to location or contacts, do you read and understand what it means?
A: No, I don’t understand all that. If it says “Allow,” I just ask my granddaughter or wait for my daughter to visit.
Q5: How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?
A: I don’t install apps on my own. My daughter does it. If she says it’s okay, I trust it.
Q6: Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?
A: No, I don’t know how to delete things. But sometimes if I think a message is not nice, I ask my granddaughter to remove it.
Q7: If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?
A: I give it as it is. I don’t know how to remove anything. I just hope the person repairing it is honest.
Q8: Have you ever asked someone to help you with a phone problem?
A: Yes, my granddaughter or daughter. I feel shy when they look at my photos or messages, but I trust them.
Q9: Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
A: I only talk in person. I don’t type anything personal on WhatsApp. My children taught me to be careful.
Q10: Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?
A: No, I don’t do that. But I sometimes say things in Malayalam if I don’t want others to understand.
Q11: Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?
A: No, I only get help. I don’t understand much, so I don’t help others with that.
Q12: Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera or location?
A: No. I’ve never done that. I don’t even know where to find that setting.
Q13: When you get a warning message (“this app may harm your phone”), what do you usually do?
A: I get scared and don’t touch it. I wait for my daughter to come and look.
Q14: What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
A: I don’t know. Maybe it helps it work better? I haven’t thought about that.
Q15: Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
A: Not really. I don’t think there’s anything secret in my phone. But I worry they might break something.
Q16: Has a repair person ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?
A: I don’t know. I don’t check after giving it. I just pray nothing bad happens.
Q17: Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?
A: No. I forget the password. My daughter kept one once and I couldn’t use the phone for two days!
Q18: Do you think local apps are safer than international ones? Why?
A: I don’t know the difference. I just use what my daughter installs. If it’s in Malayalam or simple English, I like it more.
Q19: Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?
A: My granddaughter or daughter. They explain it slowly and help me.
Q20: Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?
A: Yes. My daughter told me not to click on unknown links or messages. So now I don’t open anything unless she says so.
