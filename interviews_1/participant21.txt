Q1: What do you mainly use your phone for?
A: I mostly use the phone for calling my customers and relatives. Sometimes I use WhatsApp for sending photos of stitched clothes to customers. My nephew showed me how to do that. I also watch bhajan videos on YouTube when I get free time.
Q2: Do you share your phone with others?
A: Yes, my daughter and my husband also use my phone. My daughter uses it for her online classes or to message her friends. My husband sometimes uses it to listen to news or check cricket scores. We all use the same phone.
Section 2: Awareness and Perceptions
Q3: What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?
A: I like WhatsApp because it’s easy and I can send messages. YouTube is also good for watching sewing tutorials. I never thought about what information they take from my phone.
Q4: When an app asks for permission like access to location, camera, or contacts, do you read and understand what it means?
A: No, I just press "Allow" or “OK” because I don’t understand those words. Sometimes my daughter does it for me. I don’t know if it’s good or bad.
Q5: How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?
A: If my daughter or nephew says it is okay, I use it. I don’t download apps on my own. I don’t know how to check if it’s safe or not.
Section 3: Practices and Behaviors
Q6: Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?
A: Yes, once I deleted some photos of a customer’s dress because I didn’t want others at home to see my business details. I felt it was private work.
Q7: If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?
A: I don’t know how to delete anything, so I just give the phone. Once my son told me not to give the phone without removing photos, but I don’t know how to do that.
Q8: Have you ever asked someone to help you with a phone problem?
A: Yes, I ask my daughter or my neighbor’s boy. They help, but I feel a little nervous when they open my phone. I don’t say anything, but I feel uncomfortable.
Section 4: Trust and Sharing
Q9: Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
A: I trust talking in person. I don’t like sending anything private on the phone. I even prefer not to tell personal matters on calls if others are around.
Q10: Have you used code words, nicknames, or indirect language to keep something private?
A: Yes, sometimes I use nicknames or joke words when talking to my sister. My daughter laughs, but it’s useful when others are listening.
Section 5: Digital Literacy and Consent
Q11: Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?
A: No, I have never done that. I myself ask for help. I don’t know much about installing apps.
Q12: Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, mic, or location?
A: No. I didn’t even know that apps can use those things. If someone shows me, maybe I can learn.
Q13: When you get a warning message like “this app may harm your phone,” what do you do?
A: I get scared and ask my daughter. Once I stopped using one app because it showed a red message.
Q14: What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
A: I think maybe they only use it to work properly. I don’t know that they might send it somewhere or save it.
Section 6: Privacy and Repair
Q15: Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
A: Yes, but I had no choice. I had to give it. I just prayed that nothing bad would happen.
Q16: Has a repair person, friend, or shopkeeper ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?
A: Yes, once the repair guy opened my photo gallery. He said he was checking the camera, but I didn’t like it. I didn’t say anything though.
Q17: Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?
A: No, I don’t use a lock because my husband and daughter also use the phone. It becomes a problem if they don’t know the code.
Section 7: Trust and Social Influence
Q18: Do you think apps from local developers are safer than international ones? Why?
A: I don’t know. I don’t check who made the app. If someone I trust installs it, I believe it’s safe.
Q19: Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?
A: My daughter or my nephew. They know more and help me without making fun.
Q20: Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?
