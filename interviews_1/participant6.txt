Q1: What do you mainly use your phone for?
A.Mostly for calling passengers and using WhatsApp to coordinate rides. During free time, I watch YouTube videos or listen to devotional songs. I also sometimes check my bank balance using the bank’s SMS or app, if my nephew helps me.
Q2: Do you share your phone with others?
A.Yes, my two children sometimes use my phone to watch videos. My wife also uses it to check something on WhatsApp. I try to be careful and stay around when they use it.
Q3: What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?
A.WhatsApp because I can talk to people easily, and YouTube for entertainment. I never thought about what these apps collect from my phone.
Q4: When an app asks for permission, like access to location or contacts, do you read and understand what it means?
A.No, I just press "allow" because I think the app won’t work otherwise. Sometimes I ask my nephew what to do.
Q5: How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?
A.If many people have downloaded it or if my friends use it, then I also trust it. I don’t understand technical things, so I follow others.
Q6: Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?
A.Yes, I have deleted WhatsApp messages before if they were private or if I didn’t want my children to ask questions.
Q7: If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?
A.I remove the SIM card and memory card, but I don’t delete anything else. I never thought the repairman might check my photos.
Q8: Have you ever asked someone to help you with a phone problem?
A.Yes, I ask my nephew or a younger auto driver friend. I don’t feel shy with them—they’re like family.
Q9: Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
A.I prefer saying personal things face-to-face. I don’t trust calls or messages for that.
Q10: Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?
A.Yes, I use short names or jokes with close friends if we are talking about something sensitive.
Q11: Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?
A.I helped another driver download Google Maps. I only showed how to use it, didn’t talk about privacy or permissions.
Q12: Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera or location?
A.No, I’ve never done that. I didn’t know you could control it.
Q13: When you get a warning message (“this app may harm your phone”), what do you usually do?
A.I get scared and don’t install it. Sometimes I delete the app immediately.
Q14: What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
A.I think the app uses it for its work, like helping me connect with friends. I didn’t know they might sell or share it.
Q15: Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
A.Not really. I just go to the local mobile guy. I don’t think he’ll check my stuff.
Q16: Has a repair person ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?
A.I don’t know. I don’t check after the repair. Maybe they do.
Q17: Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?
A.Yes, I use a pattern lock, but my kids know it too. It’s just to avoid random people opening it.
Q18: Do you think local apps are safer than international ones? Why?
A.Not sure. If my friends say an app is good, I use it. Doesn’t matter if it’s Indian or foreign.
Q19: Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?
A.My nephew or fellow drivers know better. They help me.
Q20: Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?
A.Yes, my nephew told me not to click on strange links and not to answer unknown lottery calls.
