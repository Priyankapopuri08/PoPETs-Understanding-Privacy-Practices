P50, Male, Construction Worker, Age: 41 years, Education: 6th standard
Q1. What do you mainly use your phone for?
I mainly use my phone for calling my contractor, co-workers, and family members. Sometimes the contractor sends work location details on WhatsApp. I also use YouTube to watch news and construction-related videos in the evening.
Q2. Do you share your phone with others?
Yes, sometimes I share my phone with my wife or children to make calls or watch videos. I don’t like sharing it with outsiders.
Q3. What apps and features do you frequently use?
I use phone calls, WhatsApp, YouTube, the camera, and sometimes Google Maps if I go to a new work site. I also use UPI apps for small payments.
Q4. Do you read app permissions before allowing them?
I read a little. I understand basic things like camera, location, and contacts. If it looks confusing, I just allow it so the app works.
Q5. How do you decide whether an app is safe to use?
If many people use it or if my co-workers recommend it, I feel it is safe. I don’t install apps from unknown links.
Q6. Have you ever deleted messages, photos, or apps for privacy?
Yes, I delete work photos after sending them. I also delete WhatsApp forwards and videos when storage gets full.
Q7. What do you do before giving your phone for repair?
I remove the SIM card and log out of payment apps. I don’t know how to fully clean the phone, so I feel worried.
Q8. Have you asked someone for help with phone problems?
Yes, I ask my children, younger co-workers, or go to a mobile shop. Sometimes I try to fix small issues myself.
Q9. Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
I trust my wife and close family members. I don’t share personal details with co-workers or strangers.
Q10. Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?
Yes, I save some contacts with short names so others don’t understand who they are.
Q11. Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?
Yes, I helped another worker install WhatsApp and showed him how to send voice messages.
Q12. Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, microphone, or location?
I know location can be turned off. I don’t know much about camera or microphone settings.
Q13. What do you do when you get warning messages on your phone?
I read them carefully. If I don’t understand, I show them to my children or ask someone.
Q14. What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
I think the app can see those photos and numbers. I am not sure if they are stored somewhere else.
Q15. Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
Yes, because family photos, WhatsApp chats, and payment apps are there.
Q16. Has a repair person ever opened your photos or apps without asking?
Once, the repair person checked my gallery for storage. I didn’t like it, but I didn’t stop him.
Q17. Do you use a lock screen on your phone?
Yes, I use a pattern lock and sometimes fingerprint.
Q18. Do you think local apps are safer than international ones?
I don’t think about local or foreign. I think popular apps are safer.
Q19. Who do you turn to when you don’t understand phone settings?
I ask my children or younger workers at the site.
Q20. Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?
Yes, my children and co-workers talk about scams and fake calls, so I am careful.
