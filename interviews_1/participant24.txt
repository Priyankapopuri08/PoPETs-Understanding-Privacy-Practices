Q1: What do you mainly use your phone for?
A: I use it for work mostly—calls from customers, location tracking, Google Maps. In free time, I use YouTube, Instagram, and sometimes Snapchat to see what people post. Also use Paytm to check salary or send money to my family.
Q2: Do you share your phone with others?
A: Sometimes, my younger brother borrows it for gaming or watching reels. At work, colleagues may use it if their battery is dead, but only for a short time.
Section 2: Awareness and Perceptions
Q3: What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?
A: I like YouTube for entertainment and learning tricks for my bike. Also Google Maps is important for work. Snapchat is fun, but I don’t post much—just watch stories. I didn’t think about what these apps collect, honestly.
Q4: When an app asks for permission like access to location, camera, or contacts, do you read and understand what it means?
A: I read it a little, but usually just press "Allow" so the app works. If it looks fishy or unnecessary, I cancel.
Q5: How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?
A: If it's on the Play Store and my friends are using it, then I trust it. Also, if the app rating is good and has many downloads, I feel it’s okay.
Section 3: Practices and Behaviors
Q6: Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?
A: Yes, sometimes I delete chats from friends if I feel my brother or someone might see and tease me. I also delete work screenshots after sending reports.
Q7: If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?
A: First, I remove my SIM and memory card. Then I delete WhatsApp chats and photos that are personal. I’m careful because I’ve heard repair guys sometimes look into your stuff.
Q8: Have you ever asked someone to help you with a phone problem?
A: Yes, sometimes I go to the mobile shop if something is stuck. I feel a bit awkward if they open my gallery or chats, but I just stand there and watch them.
Section 4: Trust and Sharing
Q9: Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?
A: In person is best. I don’t like sharing personal things on WhatsApp or calls. Face-to-face feels safer.
Q10: Have you used code words, nicknames, or indirect language to keep something private?
A: Yes, sometimes we use nicknames in WhatsApp group chats so others don’t understand. We also talk in half-Hindi, half-Marathi when we don’t want outsiders to get it.
Section 5: Digital Literacy and Consent
Q11: Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?
A: Yes, I’ve helped my cousin install GPay and WhatsApp. I told him not to share OTPs and to lock the app.
Q12: Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, mic, or location?
A: Yes, I go to settings ? apps ? permissions and turn things off sometimes. I did that for Facebook once because it was asking for everything.
Q13: When you get a warning message like “this app may harm your phone,” what do you do?
A: I stop immediately and uninstall it. I once ignored it and got too many ads on my phone later, so now I’m careful.
Q14: What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?
A: I think they store it and maybe use it for ads. Like if I search for shoes, I get shoe ads. So I believe they see our data.
Section 6: Privacy and Repair
Q15: Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?
A: Yes. I delay going to repair shops until I’ve removed personal things. I feel nervous otherwise.
Q16: Has a repair person, friend, or shopkeeper ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?
A: Not directly, but one guy opened WhatsApp while checking. I told him "bhai, please don’t open personal things." He laughed, but stopped.
Q17: Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?
A: Yes, I use a pattern lock. My brother knows it, but no one else. I also lock WhatsApp with fingerprint.
Section 7: Trust and Social Influence
Q18: Do you think apps from local developers are safer than international ones? Why?
A: Not really. I think international ones like Google or Amazon are more secure. Local apps sometimes crash or look fake.
Q19: Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?
A: Either YouTube tutorials or my friend who works at a cyber café. He knows everything.
Q20: Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?
A: Yes, my cousin told me about not clicking unknown links or giving OTP. I follow what friends say based on their experience.
