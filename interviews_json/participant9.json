    {"question": "What do you mainly use your phone for?", "answer": "Mostly for calling my daughter who works in Delhi, and sometimes for WhatsApp messages with relatives. I also use it to watch sewing videos on YouTube when my son shows me how."},
    {"question": "Do you share your phone with others?", "answer": "Yes, I share it with my son and sometimes my husband. My son uses it to help me with apps or watch cricket. My husband uses it to call his brother."},
    {"question": "What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?", "answer": "WhatsApp is my favorite. It helps me stay in touch with my daughter. I also like YouTube because I can see sewing patterns. I don’t really think about what these apps take from my phone."},
    {"question": "When an app asks for permission, like access to location or contacts, do you read and understand what it means?", "answer": "No, I don’t understand. I just click ‘yes’, or my son helps me. Sometimes I get scared when too many things pop up."},
    {"question": "How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?", "answer": "If my son installs it or tells me it’s okay, I trust it. I don’t know how to check otherwise."},
    {"question": "Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?", "answer": "Once I deleted a message from a neighbor who kept texting, because I didn’t want any misunderstanding with my husband."},
    {"question": "If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?", "answer": "I remove the memory card if I remember. I don’t know how to delete things, so I just give it as it is. I feel worried, but I don’t know how to clean it."},
    {"question": "Have you ever asked someone to help you with a phone problem?", "answer": "Yes, my son. He helps when something is not working. I feel okay because I trust him, but I don’t like others checking my phone."},
    {"question": "Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?", "answer": "I only share personal things face-to-face. I don’t like writing anything private on the phone."},
    {"question": "Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?", "answer": "Yes, sometimes I say ‘the sweet one’ when referring to my daughter’s boyfriend, so my husband doesn’t know."},
    {"question": "Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?", "answer": "No, I need to help myself. My son helps me, but I don’t help others."},
    {"question": "Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera or location?", "answer": "No, I’ve never done that. I didn’t even know it could be done."},
    {"question": "When you get a warning message (‘this app may harm your phone’), what do you usually do?", "answer": "I get scared. I ask my son or just close the app."},
    {"question": "What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?", "answer": "I think they use it to show my photo in the app. I don’t know if they store it."},
    {"question": "Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?", "answer": "Yes. I waited two weeks once because I had personal photos and didn’t know how to delete them."},
    {"question": "Has a repair person ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?", "answer": "A shop guy once looked at my photos and laughed. I felt angry but didn’t say anything because I was scared."},
    {"question": "Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?", "answer": "No, I find it confusing. My son set it once but I forgot it."},
    {"question": "Do you think local apps are safer than international ones? Why?", "answer": "I don’t know the difference. I use what my son installs."},
    {"question": "Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?", "answer": "Always my son. He knows everything about phones."},
    {"question": "Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?", "answer": "Yes. My niece once told me not to open strange messages. I follow what they say."}
