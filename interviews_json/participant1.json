  "scenarios": {
    "Broken Phone": "I go to the local repair shop nearby. I don’t delete anything because I don’t know how. I just tell them the phone’s password if they need it. I know they might check photos, but I have no choice. I just hope they don’t misuse it.",
    "Sharing a Phone with Family": "Yes, I share my phone with my husband. If there are messages from my sister or relatives that he might not like, I delete them. Otherwise, it becomes a reason for arguments. I don’t want to fight, so I remove those messages or pictures.",
    "Installing a New App": "I don’t install apps by myself. My children do it. I don’t know what access it asks. If they say it’s safe, I say yes. Otherwise, I don’t use any new app unless it is necessary.",
    "Helping an Elderly Relative": "Actually, I myself ask for help from my children. I don’t know how to install apps or what permissions mean, so I cannot help someone else. If they ask me, I will ask my children to help us both.",
    "Using a Borrowed Phone": "I will not say anything. That is their private matter. Even if I see something by mistake, I will ignore it. I don’t like to interfere in others’ phones and expect the same from them.",
    "Selling or Giving Away a Phone": "I have not given out any old phones yet. But if I have to give, I will remove my SIM and memory card. I don’t know how to delete everything, but I can ask my children to do it.",
    "Cloud Backup Surprise": "I don’t know about Google Photos or iCloud. If deleted photos come back, I will feel scared and surprised. I think my phone is not safe. I will ask my children what happened.",
    "Using Free Public WiFi": "I don’t use WiFi or check the bank like that. I only check my balance through the message that comes to my phone. I don’t use apps for banking. And I never connect to free WiFi—I don’t know how and I don’t trust it.",
    "Receiving a lottery": "No, I will not give any details. I don’t trust such calls. I have seen on TV and WhatsApp that people lose money like that. Even if they say I won, I will first ask my children. If they say it’s fake, I will block the number.",
    "Sharing account details": "If the person is close and I trust them fully, I might transfer a small amount, but only if my children help me. I don’t know how to send money myself. If I’m unsure or don’t understand what’s happening, I won’t do it. I don’t want to make any mistakes."
