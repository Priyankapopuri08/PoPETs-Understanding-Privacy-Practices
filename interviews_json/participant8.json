    {"question": "What do you mainly use your phone for?", "answer": "I use it for WhatsApp voice messages to my customers, to take pictures of clothes I stitch, and sometimes for YouTube sewing videos. My daughter helps me with new things."},
    {"question": "Do you share your phone with others?", "answer": "Yes, my eldest daughter uses it for schoolwork, and my husband uses it if his phone isn’t working."},
    {"question": "What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?", "answer": "WhatsApp is useful for talking and sending stitched photos. YouTube gives me ideas for new designs. I don’t know what they take from my phone."},
    {"question": "When an app asks for permission, like access to location or contacts, do you read and understand what it means?", "answer": "No, I just click ‘OK’ because I don’t know what it means. I ask my daughter if something looks confusing."},
    {"question": "How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?", "answer": "If my daughter or sister-in-law uses it, then I also feel it’s okay."},
    {"question": "Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?", "answer": "Yes, I delete some WhatsApp messages if I think my husband will misunderstand."},
    {"question": "If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?", "answer": "I remove the memory card and hide some photos in another folder."},
    {"question": "Have you ever asked someone to help you with a phone problem?", "answer": "Yes, I always ask my daughter. I don’t mind her seeing messages or photos—she knows everything."},
    {"question": "Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?", "answer": "I only trust face-to-face. Even on the phone, I feel someone may be listening."},
    {"question": "Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?", "answer": "Yes, sometimes I say ‘blue cloth’ when I mean something else in front of the kids."},
    {"question": "Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?", "answer": "I’ve shown another tailor how to send voice messages on WhatsApp."},
    {"question": "Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera or location?", "answer": "No, my daughter might know."},
    {"question": "When you get a warning message (‘this app may harm your phone’), what do you usually do?", "answer": "I close the app and ask my daughter what to do."},
    {"question": "What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?", "answer": "Maybe it uses them to help me. I never thought they could go somewhere else."},
    {"question": "Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?", "answer": "Yes, once I waited for my daughter to delete some messages before we went."},
    {"question": "Has a repair person ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?", "answer": "I don’t know. I hope not. I never checked after repair."},
    {"question": "Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?", "answer": "No, it’s too confusing. I just keep the phone with me."},
    {"question": "Do you think local apps are safer than international ones? Why?", "answer": "Maybe Indian ones are better because the language is easy."},
    {"question": "Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?", "answer": "My daughter or my niece."},
    {"question": "Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?", "answer": "Yes, my sister-in-law told me not to give bank details online."}
