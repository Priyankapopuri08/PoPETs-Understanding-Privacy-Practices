            "question": "What do you mainly use your phone for?",
            "answer": "Right now, I use it mostly for WhatsApp to talk to my sister and some voice calls. I’m trying to learn how to browse for recipes and home tips on YouTube. I used to use more apps on my older phone, but this one is slow."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you share your phone with others?",
            "answer": "I rarely share this phone—it’s already second-hand and a bit delicate. Only my daughter sometimes uses it to help me with apps."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?",
            "answer": "WhatsApp and YouTube for now. I don’t know much about what apps collect. My daughter says, ‘Amma, don't click on strange messages.’"
        },
        {
            "question": "When an app asks for permission, like access to location or contacts, do you read and understand what it means?",
            "answer": "To be honest, I didn’t even notice permissions before. Now I look, but I don’t understand everything, so I just press ‘Allow’ if the app is from a known place."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?",
            "answer": "I trust the apps my daughter or relatives use. I haven’t tried anything alone yet."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?",
            "answer": "Yes, I delete old messages and group forwards because my phone has low storage space. I’ve also deleted apps that keep sending pop-ups."

            "question": "If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?",
            "answer": "I haven’t repaired this phone yet, but I would go to the local mobile shop. I’ll ask my husband to come with me because I don’t feel confident going alone with this phone."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you ever asked someone to help you with a phone problem?",
            "answer": "Yes, many times. My daughter or niece helps. I ask them to do it while I watch so I can learn, but sometimes they’re too fast!"
        },
        {
            "question": "Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?",
            "answer": "I trust family members. If I have to send something personal, I prefer to talk directly or send via WhatsApp to my husband or sister."

        {
            "question": "Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?",
            "answer": "Not yet, but I’ve seen my niece do that with her friends. It’s interesting. I might start if needed."

        {
            "question": "Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?",

            "question": "Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera or location?",
            "answer": "No, but I want to learn this. My daughter said she’ll show me in settings."
        },
        {
            "question": "When you get a warning message (‘this app may harm your phone’), what do you usually do?",
            "answer": "I get scared and stop using it. Once, I even deleted the app just to be safe."
        },
        {
            "question": "What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?",
            "answer": "I think it helps in connecting to people, but I didn’t know it might keep that data. That worries me."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?",
            "answer": "Yes, I’m afraid they might check my photos or messages. I try to delete things before giving them, or ask my daughter to do it."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has a repair person ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?",
            "answer": "Not yet. But if that happens, I would feel very uncomfortable."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?",
            "answer": "Yes, my daughter set a PIN for me. I know how to use it now."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you think local apps are safer than international ones? Why?",
            "answer": "I really don’t know. I just use the ones my family uses."
        },
        {
            "question": "Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?",
            "answer": "My daughter, niece, or sometimes my husband. I also watch YouTube if it’s a simple thing."

        {
            "question": "Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?",
