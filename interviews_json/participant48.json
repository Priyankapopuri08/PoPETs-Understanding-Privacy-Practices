    {"question": "What do you mainly use your phone for?", "answer": "I use my phone for work-related communications, like emails, HRMS portals, Google Drive, and Zoom meetings. Personally, I use WhatsApp, Instagram, a bit of Netflix, and my banking apps. I manage team rosters and employee documents on secured cloud drives. My phone is a bridge between my personal and professional life."},
    {"question": "Do you share your phone with others?", "answer": "No, I do not share my phone. My husband might borrow it to make a call, but he knows not to open apps or notifications. Otherwise, it is strictly personal."},
    {"question": "What apps and features do you frequently use?", "answer": "WhatsApp, HRMS systems, Google Sheets, banking apps, and Instagram. I know they collect data, and I manage those permissions carefully. For HR documents, I use a secure vault app."},
    {"question": "Do you read app permissions before allowing them?", "answer": "Yes, I check permissions whenever I install something new, but I might skip a few for non-critical apps like photo editors."},
    {"question": "How do you decide which apps to trust?", "answer": "I trust apps with good reviews, known brands, and preferably those that are compliant with GDPR or Indian privacy standards."},
    {"question": "Do you delete content for privacy reasons?", "answer": "Yes, I delete sensitive employee documents, payslips, or any salary details after sending them. I also clear screenshots with confidential HR memos regularly."},
    {"question": "What do you do before giving your phone for repair?", "answer": "I back up my data, sign out of every HRMS app, delete financial apps, then wipe the device before going to an authorized Apple store. If I have no time to wipe, I postpone the repair."},
    {"question": "Who do you ask for help with phone-related problems?", "answer": "I will reach out to Apple support or my office IT team. I never ask random technicians."},
    {"question": "Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?", "answer": "My husband and my office IT team. Beyond them, no one."},
    {"question": "Have you used code words or nicknames to keep information private?", "answer": "Yes, in HR messages, we use codes for employees or projects so that details are not easily exposed."},
    {"question": "Have you helped others install or use apps?", "answer": "Yes, I have helped junior staff install HR apps. I always explain about giving permission carefully, especially camera and microphone access."},
    {"question": "Do you manage app permissions actively?", "answer": "Yes, I monitor permissions and remove camera or mic access for apps I rarely use."},
    {"question": "How do you respond to warning messages from apps?", "answer": "I take them seriously. I verify them on the App Store or by asking IT."},
    {"question": "What do you think happens when you allow access to contacts or media?", "answer": "I know that when I allow contact or media access, those files could sync to external servers."},
    {"question": "Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair due to privacy concerns?", "answer": "Yes, because there is employee data on my phone. I never leave it without wiping or signing out of accounts."},
    {"question": "Has anyone ever accessed your data during repair without permission?", "answer": "No, because I take every step to wipe data first."},
    {"question": "Do you use a lock screen or additional security?", "answer": "Yes – Face ID, plus a 6-digit passcode, and my WhatsApp has an extra fingerprint lock."},
    {"question": "Do you prefer local or foreign apps?", "answer": "I use whichever app is transparent with its privacy policy and well-known. I do not blindly prefer local or foreign."},
    {"question": "Who helps you when you don’t understand phone settings?", "answer": "My husband and the office IT team."},
    {"question": "Do people around you influence your online safety practices?", "answer": "My office has cybersecurity trainings, which influence me a lot to follow proper practices."}
