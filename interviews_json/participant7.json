    {"question": "What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?", "answer": "Snapchat, WhatsApp, Instagram. I don’t really think about data. I just click ‘Allow’. My friends do the same."},

    {"question": "Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?", "answer": "Yes, especially when I have chats I don’t want my brother to see. I also delete screenshots and messages from Snapchat."},

    {"question": "When you get a warning message (‘this app may harm your phone’), what do you usually do?", "answer": "If I really need it, I install it anyway. Otherwise, I ignore it."},

    {"question": "Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?", "answer": "Yes. I felt embarrassed about the chats and photos, but I needed to fix it."},
    {"question": "Has a repair person ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?", "answer": "Yes, my cousin once. I got angry and added a fingerprint lock."},
    {"question": "Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?", "answer": "Yes, fingerprint and pattern both. I don’t want anyone checking my phone."},
    {"question": "Do you think local apps are safer than international ones? Why?", "answer": "I don’t know. I just use what’s trending."},
    {"question": "Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?", "answer": "My cousin sometimes searches YouTube."},
    {"question": "Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?", "answer": "Yes, my friends tell me not to use random links. We talk about scams sometimes."}
