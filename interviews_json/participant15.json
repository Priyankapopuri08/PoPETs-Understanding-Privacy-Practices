    {"question": "What do you mainly use your phone for?", "answer": "I use my phone mostly for work—Google Maps for delivery, Zomato Partner app, WhatsApp for talking to friends, and Paytm for money transactions. I also watch YouTube shorts and reels. I sometimes use Snapchat, mainly for filters with friends."},
    {"question": "Do you share your phone with others?", "answer": "Not really. Only if a friend urgently needs to make a call or check something. I don’t like people touching my phone too much."},
    {"question": "What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?", "answer": "I like Google Maps and YouTube. Snapchat is fun for timepass. I know these apps take data because I get ads based on what I search, especially on YouTube and Facebook."},
    {"question": "When an app asks for permission, like to access your location or camera, do you read and understand what it means?", "answer": "Sometimes I read, but mostly I allow it if the app looks safe or I’ve used it before. For unknown apps, I think twice."},
    {"question": "How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?", "answer": "If it has many downloads on Play Store, or if my friends use it, I trust it. I also check reviews and whether it looks clean and professional."},
    {"question": "Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?", "answer": "Yes, I delete chats sometimes if I think someone might misinterpret. Even silly chats with female friends can cause drama."},
    {"question": "If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?", "answer": "I log out of apps like Paytm and delete private photos or move them to Google Drive. I also try to clean the gallery and cache."},
    {"question": "Have you ever asked someone to help you with a phone problem?", "answer": "Yes, my cousin is very techy. I trust him, but I sit beside him when he’s fixing something—just in case."},
    {"question": "Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?", "answer": "In person. Face-to-face is better than on phone. I don’t trust calls or messages for personal stuff."},
    {"question": "Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?", "answer": "Definitely! Especially while chatting in groups or with a girlfriend. We use names that only we understand."},
    {"question": "Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?", "answer": "Yes, I’ve helped many coworkers with Zomato onboarding, Paytm setup, even UPI. I explain about permissions and to be careful with unknown links."},
    {"question": "Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, microphone, or location?", "answer": "Yes, I go to app settings and turn off permissions sometimes. Especially for apps I don’t trust."},
    {"question": "When you get a warning message (‘this app may harm your phone’), what do you usually do?", "answer": "I avoid it. I don’t want to risk my phone getting slow or hacked."},
    {"question": "What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?", "answer": "I think it may use it to show ads, or sometimes even sell the data. I’m not fully sure how, but I feel it’s not good to give every app that permission."},
    {"question": "Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?", "answer": "Yes. I delay repairs until I back everything up or remove sensitive stuff."},
    {"question": "Has a repair person ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?", "answer": "Once a guy opened my photos ‘by mistake’ and smiled at something. I didn’t say anything but felt very angry."},
    {"question": "Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?", "answer": "Yes, fingerprint and PIN. No one else knows it. It’s basic security."},
    {"question": "Do you think local apps are safer than international ones? Why?", "answer": "Depends. I trust big names like Google or Instagram more than random Indian apps. But local language apps are easier for some people."},
    {"question": "Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?", "answer": "Cousin, or sometimes I watch YouTube tutorials."},
    {"question": "Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?", "answer": "Yes. My friends share warnings on WhatsApp about scams, like ‘don’t click this link’ etc."}
