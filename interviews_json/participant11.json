            "question": "What do you mainly use your phone for?",
            "answer": "Mostly for calling my children and relatives. I use WhatsApp to see the photos my daughter sends. Sometimes I listen to devotional songs on YouTube, but only when my granddaughter helps me open the app."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you share your phone with others?",
            "answer": "Yes, my granddaughter uses it to play games and watch cartoons when she visits. My husband also sometimes takes it to call someone if his phone is charging."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?",
            "answer": "WhatsApp is my favorite because I get to see my family’s photos. I don’t really think about what the apps collect. My daughter once told me not to click on anything new."

            "question": "When an app asks for permission, like access to location or contacts, do you read and understand what it means?",
            "answer": "No, I don’t understand all that. If it says ‘Allow,’ I just ask my granddaughter or wait for my daughter to visit."

            "question": "How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?",
            "answer": "I don’t install apps on my own. My daughter does it. If she says it’s okay, I trust it."
        },

            "question": "Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?",

        {
            "question": "Have you ever asked someone to help you with a phone problem?",
            "answer": "Yes, my granddaughter or daughter. I feel shy when they look at my photos or messages, but I trust them."

            "question": "Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?",

            "question": "Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?",

            "question": "Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera or location?",

            "question": "When you get a warning message (‘this app may harm your phone’), what do you usually do?",
            "answer": "I get scared and don’t touch it. I wait for my daughter to come and look."
        },
        {
            "question": "What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?",
            "answer": "I don’t know. Maybe it helps it work better? I haven’t thought about that."

            "question": "Has a repair person ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?",

            "question": "Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?",

        {
            "question": "Do you think local apps are safer than international ones? Why?",
            "answer": "I don’t know the difference. I just use what my daughter installs. If it’s in Malayalam or simple English, I like it more."

        {
            "question": "Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?",

            "question": "Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?",
