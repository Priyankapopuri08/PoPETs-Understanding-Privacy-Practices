            "question": "What do you mainly use your phone for?",
            "answer": "I mostly use my phone to talk to my family and friends through calls and WhatsApp messages. Sometimes I listen to music and watch small videos. I don’t use many apps because I don’t understand them well."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you share your phone with others?",
            "answer": "Yes, I share my phone with my husband and children sometimes. They use it to call relatives or watch videos. It happens a few times a week, especially when they need to check something quickly."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?",
            "answer": "I like WhatsApp because it helps me talk to family far away. I also watch videos on YouTube. I don’t really think about what information these apps take; I just want to use them easily."
        },
        {
            "question": "When an app asks for permission, like to access your location, camera, or contacts, do you read and understand what it means?",
            "answer": "No, I usually just press ‘Allow’ because the app won’t work without it. I don’t always read the messages or know what the permissions mean."
        },

            "question": "How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?",
            "answer": "I trust apps that my family or neighbors use. If someone I know says it’s good, I use it. Otherwise, I don’t open many new apps."

            "question": "Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?",

            "question": "If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?",
            "answer": "I usually just give the phone as it is. I feel worried that someone might see my photos or messages, but I don’t know how to remove them."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you ever asked someone to help you with a phone problem?",
            "answer": "Yes, I ask my son or the repair shop. I feel uncomfortable but I don’t have a choice. Sometimes I hope they don’t look at my private things."

            "question": "Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?",

        {
            "question": "Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?",

            "question": "Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?",
            "answer": "No, I don’t feel confident to help others. My son sometimes helps me."

        },
        {
            "question": "When you get a warning message (‘this app may harm your phone’), what do you usually do?",
            "answer": "I usually ignore the warning because I don’t understand it. Sometimes I uninstall the app if it stops working."
        },
        {
            "question": "What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?",
            "answer": "I think the app uses them to help me share pictures or talk to people. I don’t know if they keep or share the data elsewhere."
        },

            "question": "Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?",

            "question": "Has a repair person ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?",
            "answer": "Yes, once the repair person looked at my photos. I felt uncomfortable but didn’t say anything because I was shy."
        },

            "question": "Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?",
            "answer": "No, I don’t use a password because I find it hard to remember. Sometimes my husband uses my phone."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you think apps from local developers are safer than international ones? Why?",
            "answer": "I don’t really think about that. If the app is in my language, I feel more comfortable."
