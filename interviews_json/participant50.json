    {"question": "What do you mainly use your phone for?", "answer": "I mainly use my phone for calling my contractor, co-workers, and family members. Sometimes the contractor sends work location details on WhatsApp. I also use YouTube to watch news and construction-related videos in the evening."},
    {"question": "Do you share your phone with others?", "answer": "Yes, sometimes I share my phone with my wife or children to make calls or watch videos. I don’t like sharing it with outsiders."},
    {"question": "What apps and features do you frequently use?", "answer": "I use phone calls, WhatsApp, YouTube, the camera, and sometimes Google Maps if I go to a new work site. I also use UPI apps for small payments."},
    {"question": "Do you read app permissions before allowing them?", "answer": "I read a little. I understand basic things like camera, location, and contacts. If it looks confusing, I just allow it so the app works."},
    {"question": "How do you decide whether an app is safe to use?", "answer": "If many people use it or if my co-workers recommend it, I feel it is safe. I don’t install apps from unknown links."},
    {"question": "Have you ever deleted messages, photos, or apps for privacy?", "answer": "Yes, I delete work photos after sending them. I also delete WhatsApp forwards and videos when storage gets full."},
    {"question": "What do you do before giving your phone for repair?", "answer": "I remove the SIM card and log out of payment apps. I don’t know how to fully clean the phone, so I feel worried."},
    {"question": "Have you asked someone for help with phone problems?", "answer": "Yes, I ask my children, younger co-workers, or go to a mobile shop. Sometimes I try to fix small issues myself."},
    {"question": "Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?", "answer": "I trust my wife and close family members. I don’t share personal details with co-workers or strangers."},
    {"question": "Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?", "answer": "Yes, I save some contacts with short names so others don’t understand who they are."},
    {"question": "Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?", "answer": "Yes, I helped another worker install WhatsApp and showed him how to send voice messages."},
    {"question": "Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, microphone, or location?", "answer": "I know location can be turned off. I don’t know much about camera or microphone settings."},
    {"question": "What do you do when you get warning messages on your phone?", "answer": "I read them carefully. If I don’t understand, I show them to my children or ask someone."},
    {"question": "What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?", "answer": "I think the app can see those photos and numbers. I am not sure if they are stored somewhere else."},
    {"question": "Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?", "answer": "Yes, because family photos, WhatsApp chats, and payment apps are there."},
    {"question": "Has a repair person ever opened your photos or apps without asking?", "answer": "Once, the repair person checked my gallery for storage. I didn’t like it, but I didn’t stop him."},
    {"question": "Do you use a lock screen on your phone?", "answer": "Yes, I use a pattern lock and sometimes fingerprint."},
    {"question": "Do you think local apps are safer than international ones?", "answer": "I don’t think about local or foreign. I think popular apps are safer."},
    {"question": "Who do you turn to when you don’t understand phone settings?", "answer": "I ask my children or younger workers at the site."},
    {"question": "Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?", "answer": "Yes, my children and co-workers talk about scams and fake calls, so I am careful."}
