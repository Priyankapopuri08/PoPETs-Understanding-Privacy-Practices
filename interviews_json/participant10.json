    {"question": "What do you mainly use your phone for?", "answer": "I use it mostly for work—Zomato delivery app, maps, and OTPs. Personally, I use WhatsApp, YouTube, and sometimes Snapchat to share funny videos with friends. I also use Paytm for payments and checking my balance."},
    {"question": "Do you share your phone with others?", "answer": "Sometimes with my younger cousin or friends when they want to browse something. But I don’t like sharing it much, especially when I’m logged into apps for work."},
    {"question": "What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?", "answer": "Google Maps and Paytm for work. YouTube is my favorite for entertainment. Snapchat is fun too. I know these apps collect some data, like location or what I search for, but I think that’s normal nowadays."},
    {"question": "When an app asks for permission, like access to location or contacts, do you read and understand what it means?", "answer": "I understand location and camera. I allow it if I trust the app. If it’s a random app, I get suspicious."},
    {"question": "How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use?", "answer": "I check ratings and reviews. If it looks professional and many people use it, I trust it. Also, I avoid apps with too many ads or ones recommended by strangers on WhatsApp."},
    {"question": "Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it?", "answer": "Yes, sometimes I delete chats or photos before giving my phone to someone. Mostly jokes from friends or memes that could be misunderstood."},
    {"question": "If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over?", "answer": "I log out of all my apps and delete photos and work data. I also remove my SIM and memory card. I’m careful because everything is linked to my account."},
    {"question": "Have you ever asked someone to help you with a phone problem?", "answer": "Yes, sometimes my tech-savvy friend. I try not to let him open my chats or gallery. If needed, I sit beside him and explain what to fix."},
    {"question": "Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?", "answer": "In-person, always. If I have to share on the phone, I prefer WhatsApp voice messages to SMS. I avoid putting things in text."},
    {"question": "Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?", "answer": "Yes, with close friends. We say ‘blue file’ for things we don’t want others to understand, like girlfriends or party plans."},
    {"question": "Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?", "answer": "Many times, especially older relatives. I explain how to use Paytm, and sometimes I tell them not to click ‘Allow’ on everything."},
    {"question": "Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera or location?", "answer": "Yes. I go to settings and turn off permissions if I feel something is fishy or not needed."},
    {"question": "When you get a warning message (‘this app may harm your phone’), what do you usually do?", "answer": "I uninstall it or don’t install at all. I’ve learned my lesson—once my phone got slow after installing such an app."},
    {"question": "What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?", "answer": "I think some apps use it for marketing or showing you ads. That’s why I don’t give contact access unless it’s WhatsApp or something useful."},
    {"question": "Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?", "answer": "Yes. I delayed it once and backed up everything to the cloud, then deleted it before going. Privacy is a real concern."},
    {"question": "Has a repair person ever opened your gallery or apps without asking?", "answer": "Once, a guy opened my WhatsApp. I told him clearly not to go into my personal stuff. He apologized."},
    {"question": "Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not?", "answer": "Yes. Fingerprint lock and PIN. I don’t want anyone opening it, even by mistake."},
    {"question": "Do you think local apps are safer than international ones? Why?", "answer": "Not always. I think international apps have more security, but local ones are easier in language. I check both."},
    {"question": "Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting?", "answer": "My friend Ranjeet. He fixes everything. He watches tech videos and knows a lot."},
    {"question": "Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?", "answer": "Yes. One friend told me never to use public WiFi for banking. Since then, I have followed that."}

  "scenarios": {
    "Broken Phone": "I back up data on Drive or memory card, log out of all apps, and delete chats and photos. Only then I give it.",
    "Sharing with Family": "If a message comes, I quickly check it or delete it later. I don’t let others scroll freely.",
    "New App Requesting Permissions": "I check why it needs those permissions. If it doesn’t make sense, I skip it.",
    "Helping Elderly Relative": "I explain permissions—like why camera or location is asked. I say ‘only allow if needed.’",
    "Using Someone Else’s Phone": "If I see a private message or pic, I just ignore it. It’s their phone, their space.",
    "Giving Away Phone": "I format it completely, remove Google account, and reset it. I also take out SIM and SD card.",
    "Cloud Backup Surprise": "That actually happened to me! I deleted a photo, but it showed up on Google Photos. Now I always delete it from both places.",
    "Free Public WiFi": "I connect only to watch videos. Never for banking or login. I heard it's risky.",
    "Lottery Call": "I cut the call. No such luck exists. They just want your bank info.",
    "Friend Needs Help": "If I trust the friend, I’ll send it. But I confirm on call first—no text-only requests."
