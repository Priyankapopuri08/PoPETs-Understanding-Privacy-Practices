            "question": "What do you mainly use your phone for?",
            "answer": "Mostly for calling passengers and using WhatsApp to coordinate rides. During free time, I watch YouTube videos or listen to devotional songs. I also sometimes check my bank balance using the bank’s SMS or app, if my nephew helps me."

            "question": "Do you share your phone with others?",

            "question": "What are your favorite apps or features on your phone?",

            "answer": "If many people have downloaded it or if my friends use it, then I also trust it. I don’t understand technical things, so I follow others."

            "question": "Have you ever asked someone to help you with a phone problem?",

        {
            "question": "What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?",
            "answer": "I think the app uses it for its work, like helping me connect with friends. I didn’t know they might sell or share it."

            "question": "Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?",

        {
            "question": "Do you think local apps are safer than international ones? Why?",
            "answer": "Not sure. If my friends say an app is good, I use it. Doesn’t matter if it’s Indian or foreign."
