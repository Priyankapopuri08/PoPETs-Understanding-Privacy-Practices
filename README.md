# “I Just Press Allow”: Understanding Privacy Practices of New Internet Users in Urban India
This repository contains 50 interview transcripts collected and analyzed for the 2026 Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS 26) paper titled *“I Just Press Allow”: Understanding Privacy Practices of New Internet Users in Urban India*. 

## Abstract
In rapidly digitizing countries, like India, many people are adopting the Internet for the first time through smartphones. Such new users, with little prior exposure to digital systems, face applications and services that access personal and private data, often leaving no agency with the users to exercise a choice. This creates an imbalance between the power of data-driven platforms and the limited digital literacy of users, raising urgent privacy and security concerns.  While prior research has studied experienced Internet populations, far less is known about how first-time users in the emerging markets think about and act on privacy risks. 

We present findings from interviews with 50 new Internet users in India, spanning diverse social and economic backgrounds. Our study shows that privacy is often managed by family members and local intermediaries, with users depending on them for key decisions. Participants held incomplete or inaccurate understandings of data collection, while prioritizing visible threats like fraud and device theft. The findings reveal a mismatch between formal privacy controls and the realities of everyday practice. We outline design and policy directions to support consent and security in ways that reflect the experiences of new Internet users.

## Research Overview
Despite the growing importance of embedding privacy into software products by design, addressing legal requirements and user privacy concerns has proven challenging in practice. This challenge has led researchers and practitioners to develop various methods, techniques, tools, and other solutions that consider privacy throughout the software engineering process. Many of these approaches eventually formed the basis for an emerging and rapidly expanding field of *privacy engineering*, receiving significant attention from industry, government, and academic stakeholders.

Rapid growth and recognition have contributed to an increase in scholarship on privacy engineering goals (the “what”) and methods of achieving them (the “how”). **However, a critical gap remains in understanding who is, or should be, responsible for putting these methods into practice and achieving these goals within organizations**. 

To define the role of a *privacy engineer*, we considered the following research questions:

* **RQ1:** How do privacy engineers conceptualize their roles?
* **RQ2:** What motivates individuals to pursue privacy engineering?
* **RQ3:** What are the core competencies associated with privacy engineering?
* **RQ4:** What do privacy engineers find challenging in their roles, and what strategies do they find effective in overcoming these challenges?

We chose semi-structured interviews because of the open-ended nature of our research questions. Furthermore, semi-structured interviews allowed us to investigate participants’ responses further
and skip questions as needed while maintaining the structure of our interview guide.

### Interview Guide
We developed our interview guide to highlight the unique characteristics of a privacy engineering role and to enable comparison with other similar but distinct privacy roles. To achieve this goal, we divided the interview into six distinct sections that cover: (1) participants’ understanding of privacy engineering, (2) their motivation to pursue privacy engineering as a profession, (3) responsibilities and skills, (4) reporting and deliverables, (5) challenges and strategies, (6) evaluating success. All authors reviewed and provided suggestions for the interview protocol, including two authors with extensive experience as privacy engineering practitioners within their respective organizations.

### Interview Questions

The dataset consists of 27 participants' de-identified responses to the following questions:

**Topic 1 - Introduction**
1. Can you tell me briefly about what you do in your job?
2. Could you also define the term “privacy” as you normally use it in your work context?
3. How would you describe the roles in the industry related to privacy engineering?
4. How would you define a “privacy engineer”?

**Topic 2 - Motivation**
1. How did you become interested in privacy engineering as a career (or a function of your career)?
2. Could you share your career journey and how you arrived at your current position?
3. What motivates you to continue pursuing privacy engineering as part of your profession?
     * What are some personal goals you have for this work?
     * What value do you get from it?
     * What do you enjoy about it?
4. Now I am going to ask you a question about the future. A year from now, do you see yourself in the same position? More specifically, doing what it is that you currently do in your position.
     * Can you tell me more about why you answered this way?

**Topic 3 - Responsibilities and Skills**
1. Could you give me an idea of what a typical day at work looks like for you?
2. What responsibilities does your employer expect you to take on at work?
3. Why do you think there is such a [difference/similarity] between the expectation and the reality?
4. Are there any additional responsibilities you feel you are expected to take on in your role, such as to society, others in the organization, or even yourself?
     * For instance, serving your broader community or other privacy professionals, mentoring others, volunteering your time, and so on.
5. What skills were demanded of you when you started your current role?
6. What are the skills you currently use in your job?
7. Is there a difference or not between the skills you were expected to demonstrate during the interviewing process and those required of you in your role?

**Topic 4 - Reporting and Deliverables**
1. Who do you report to?
2. Does anyone report to you?
3. What are the typical reporting structures that you see in your profession?
     * What are the teams and their composition of reporting?
     * What methods do you use to report to others (e.g., meetings, emails, project management platforms)?
     * What is the actual organizational structure (e.g., flat vs hierarchical)?
4. What deliverables are required from you in your role? For example, do you write code, research reports, Privacy-by-Design (PbD) advice, etc?
     * Can you tell me more about why these deliverables are important in your role?
     * Do you think these deliverables are typical or not typical for someone in your profession?
