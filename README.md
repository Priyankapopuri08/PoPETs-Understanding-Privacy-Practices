# “I Just Press Allow”: Understanding Privacy Practices of New Internet Users in Urban India
This repository contains 50 interview transcripts collected and analyzed for the 2026 Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS 26) paper titled *“I Just Press Allow”: Understanding Privacy Practices of New Internet Users in Urban India*. 

## Abstract
In rapidly digitizing countries, like India, many people are adopting the Internet for the first time through smartphones. Such new users, with little prior exposure to digital systems, face applications and services that access personal and private data, often leaving no agency with the users to exercise a choice. This creates an imbalance between the power of data-driven platforms and the limited digital literacy of users, raising urgent privacy and security concerns.  While prior research has studied experienced Internet populations, far less is known about how first-time users in the emerging markets think about and act on privacy risks. 

We present findings from interviews with 50 new Internet users in India, spanning diverse social and economic backgrounds. Our study shows that privacy is often managed by family members and local intermediaries, with users depending on them for key decisions. Participants held incomplete or inaccurate understandings of data collection, while prioritizing visible threats like fraud and device theft. The findings reveal a mismatch between formal privacy controls and the realities of everyday practice. We outline design and policy directions to support consent and security in ways that reflect the experiences of new Internet users.

## Research Overview
Mobile phones have become the primary gateway to the internet for millions of first-time internet users in India, driven by the affordability of smartphones and the expansion of digital services. This rapid adoption has created a diverse population of “new internet users” who often have limited digital experience, low literacy, and little exposure to formal training with technology. Despite their growing online presence, most digital systems continue to assume experienced users, leaving newcomers to navigate complex interfaces, privacy settings, and security decisions with minimal guidance.

While significant technical progress has been made in strengthening privacy through encryption, authentication, and secure architectures, far less attention has been given to how novice users actually understand, interpret, and act on privacy and security cues. Their experiences are further shaped by social realities such as shared device use, dependence on family or shopkeepers for setup, and informal repair practices. As a result, many existing privacy protections fail to align with everyday practices, increasing vulnerability to fraud, data misuse, and unauthorized access. 

To address these gaps, we conducted a qualitative study with 50 first-time or early-stage smartphone users across varied socio-economic and regional contexts in India. Our work examines how these users perceive privacy and security, and how their socio-cultural environments shape their decisions and associated risks.

Our study is guided by the following research questions:

* **RQ1:** How do household relationships and reliance on digitally literate family members shape privacy decisions and experiences?
* **RQ2:** What informal strategies and everyday workarounds do users adopt when formal controls are difficult to understand or use?
* **RQ3:** Why do users consent to apps despite mistrust, and what does this reveal about the limits of current consent models?

We used semi-structured interviews because they allow flexibility to explore users’ experiences in depth while maintaining a consistent structure across diverse participants.

### Interview Guide
We designed our interview guide to capture how first-time and early-stage smartphone users understand, experience, and navigate privacy and security in everyday mobile use. To accomplish this, we organized the interview into sections covering general phone practices, awareness and perceptions, behaviors around sharing and repair, trust and social influence, and responses to realistic scenario-based situations. The guide was iteratively refined to ensure clarity, cultural relevance, and alignment with our research questions.

### Interview Questions

The dataset consists of 50 participants' de-identified responses to the following questions:

**Topic 1 - General Mobile Use:**
1. What do you mainly use your phone for? (For example, do you use it for calling, texting, WhatsApp, watching videos, checking bank balance, or anything else?) 
2. Do you share your phone with others? If yes, with whom and how often? (Who uses it: your family, friends, or someone else? How often do they use it?

**Topic 2 - Awareness and Perceptions**

1. What are your favorite apps or features on your phone? (Why do you use those apps: for chatting, shopping, learning, and entertainment? Have you ever thought about what information these apps might be collecting from your phone?)
2. When an app asks for permission, like to access your location, camera, or contacts, do you read and understand what it means? (Do you allow it without thinking, or do you ask someone, or decide based on your own judgment?)
3. How do you decide whether an app or website is safe to use? (Do you trust it if it’s popular? If friends use it? If it looks professional?)

**Topic 3 - Practices and Behaviors**
1. Have you ever deleted a message, photo, or app because you didn’t want someone to see it? (Can you share what made you do that? Was it for privacy or to avoid conflict?)
2. If your phone stops working and you need to give it for repair, what do you do before handing it over? (Do you clear your data, remove photos, or just give it as is?)
3. Have you ever asked someone (friend/repairer/child) to help you with a phone problem? How did you feel about them seeing your personal data? (How did you feel about them seeing your photos or private messages while helping?)

**Topic 4 - Trust and Sharing**

1. Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information? (E.g., in-person vs. over the phone or via apps). When you need to share something private (like bank info or personal messages), who do you trust more: talking in person, calling, or using apps like WhatsApp or SMS?
2. Have you used code words, nicknames, or indirect language to keep something private? (Can you give an example: like talking in jokes, slang, or using another language?)

**Topic 5 - Digital Literacy and Consent**

1. Have you ever helped someone install or use an app? What did you explain to them? (What things did you explain to them? Did you talk about privacy or safety?)
2. Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, microphone, or location? (Have you ever done this before or seen anyone do it?)
3. When you get a warning message (e.g., “this app may harm your phone”), what do you usually do? (Do you install it anyway, uninstall it, or ask someone for help?)
4. What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos? (Do you think it stores it, shares it, or uses it for ads?)

**Topic 6 - Privacy and Repair**

1. Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content? (Like photos, chats, bank info, or other personal things?)
2. Has a repair person, friend, or shopkeeper ever opened your gallery or apps without asking while using or fixing your phone? How did you feel? (Did you say anything to them? Did it bother you?)
3. Do you use a password or lock screen on your phone? Why or why not? (Does anyone else know your password?)

**Topic 7 - Trust and Social Influence**

1. Do you think apps from local developers are safer than international ones? Why? (What makes you feel something is trustworthy: language, popularity, or something else?)
2. Who do you turn to when you don’t understand a phone or app setting? (Do you ask family, children, shopkeepers, or friends?)
3. Do people around you (family, friends, shopkeepers) influence the way you think about online safety? (Have they given you any advice or taught you anything about staying safe online?)

**Topic 8 - Scenario-based questions:**

1. Broken Phone: Imagine your phone suddenly stops working, and you need to take it to a local repair shop. It has your photos, bank app, and personal messages. What do you do before handing it over? Do you delete things? Do you worry about the repair person accessing your content?
2. Sharing a Phone with Family: Let’s say your sibling or spouse often borrows your phone. You receive a private message. What do you do? Do you hide apps? Use patterns? Delete messages?
3. Installing a New App: A new app promises rewards or entertainment, but asks for access to your contacts and location. Would you install it? What do you consider before saying yes? Do you know what these permissions mean?
4. Helping an Elderly Relative: Your older relative has a smartphone, but doesn’t understand permissions. They ask you to install a health or finance app for them. What do you do? Do you explain the permissions? Do you think it’s important for them to understand?
5. Using a Borrowed Phone: Imagine you’re using a friend’s or relative’s phone to check something online. You see a private photo or message pop up. What would you do?  Do you tell them? Ignore it? Does this ever happen?
6. Selling or Giving Away a Phone: You plan to give your old phone to someone else. What steps do you take before handing it over? Do you delete apps? Format it? Worry about any leftover data?
7. Cloud Backup Surprise: You delete photos from your phone, but later find out they are still on Google Photos or iCloud. How would you react?
8. Using Free Public WiFi: You find free WiFi at a cafe and need to check your bank account. Would you connect? Why or why not? What steps would you take?
9. Receiving a lottery: Imagine you ever receive a call from a number you don’t recognize, stating that you have won 1 lakh in a lucky draw. Would you give your details?
10. Sharing account details: Your friend is out of town and runs into an emergency that requires a money transfer since their bank account does not have enough money. Will you transfer the money? Why or why not?
