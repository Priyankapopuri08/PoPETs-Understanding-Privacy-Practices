    {"question": "What do you mainly use your phone for?", "answer": "I mainly use my phone for calling my supervisor, residents, and family members. Sometimes residents call me if the gate is locked or if a delivery has come. I also use WhatsApp to receive duty messages and voice calls. At night, I watch YouTube videos for time pass."},
    {"question": "Do you share your phone with others?", "answer": "Yes, sometimes I share my phone with my wife or children to make calls or watch videos. I don’t share it with outsiders."},
    {"question": "What apps and features do you frequently use?", "answer": "I mostly use phone calls, WhatsApp, YouTube, and the camera. I use the camera if the supervisor asks for photos of the gate or surroundings. I don’t use many other apps."},
    {"question": "Do you read app permissions before allowing them?", "answer": "No, I don’t read them. I cannot understand what is written. If the app doesn’t work, I press ‘Allow’."},
    {"question": "How do you decide whether an app is safe to use?", "answer": "If my supervisor, friends, or my children say the app is okay, then I use it. I don’t install apps by myself."},
    {"question": "Have you ever deleted messages, photos, or apps for privacy?", "answer": "Yes, I delete photos after sending them to my supervisor. I also delete WhatsApp messages when my phone memory becomes full."},
    {"question": "What do you do before giving your phone for repair?", "answer": "I remove the SIM card. I don’t know how to delete everything properly, so I feel worried when giving it for repair."},
    {"question": "Have you asked someone for help with phone problems?", "answer": "Yes, I ask my children or go to a nearby mobile shop. I feel uncomfortable because they can see my phone, but I need help."},
    {"question": "Who do you trust most when sharing personal or sensitive information?", "answer": "I trust my wife and children. I don’t trust strangers or residents with personal matters."},
    {"question": "Have you used code words or nicknames to keep something private?", "answer": "Yes, I save some contacts with short names so others don’t understand who they are."},
    {"question": "Have you ever helped someone install or use an app?", "answer": "I helped another watchman use WhatsApp calling. I only showed him how to answer calls."},
    {"question": "Do you know how to stop an app from using your camera, microphone, or location?", "answer": "No, I don’t know how to do that. I didn’t know apps could use those things without opening them."},
    {"question": "What do you do when you get warning messages on your phone?", "answer": "I get scared and close the message. I usually show it to my children or ask someone else."},
    {"question": "What do you think happens when you give an app access to your contacts or photos?", "answer": "I think the app can see those photos and contacts. I don’t know what happens after that."},
    {"question": "Have you ever hesitated to take your phone for repair because of private content?", "answer": "Yes, because family photos and WhatsApp messages are there. I feel shy and worried."},
    {"question": "Has a repair person ever opened your photos or apps without asking?", "answer": "Once, the repair person opened my phone to check storage. I didn’t say anything, but I felt bad."},
    {"question": "Do you use a lock screen on your phone?", "answer": "Yes, I use a pattern lock. My wife also knows it."},
    {"question": "Do you think local apps are safer than international ones?", "answer": "I don’t know the difference. I use whatever others tell me to use."},
    {"question": "Who do you turn to when you don’t understand phone settings?", "answer": "I ask my children or sometimes another watchman who knows phones better."},
    {"question": "Do people around you influence how you think about online safety?", "answer": "Yes, my children and friends tell me not to share OTPs and not to answer unknown calls. I listen to them."}
